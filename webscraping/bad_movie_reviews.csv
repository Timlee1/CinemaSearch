0,tt0090009,/review/rw0226636/?ref_=tt_urv,"This is an hysterical romp, a mix of Conan and Mad Max, made with a lot of colorful, unfinished ideas, mixed up in a total mess, a bad movie that is fun to watch because you ever know what will come next. In this, it is a great Z-movie, almost fun as Plan 9 from outer space, but if you search for a serious sword and sorcery clone, stay away. For fun of B-movies only"
1,tt0090009,/review/rw2473085/?ref_=tt_urv,"This is exactly what bad movies are supposed to be: a magnificent accident; bizarre; terrible dialog; insipid acting; but most importantly, uncontrived. Not like that Troma crap. Troma wishes its movies were bad, but all I see are contrivances: people who try to pawn off badly made bad movies as something special, like She. She is everything you want and more. Badly executed scenes for even more badly conceived plot points. Terrible costuming including spiked football helmets intended to look ""post- apocalyptic"". Male sexual fantasies enacted on screen, masquerading as female empowerment. But through all of it, an effortless ""badness"" that leaves one questioning, simply, ""how?"". How did this make it to film? How did it actually get made, and who actually looked at the final cut and said 'yep, it's just like I imagined it. Trust me, this is a golden turd. It's the reason we bother to watch terrible movies."
2,tt0090009,/review/rw1493698/?ref_=tt_urv,"Mix together sword-and-sorcery and post-apocalyptic elements, add a dose of political allegory (note the Communist and Nazi symbols), a contemporary music score and some surreal moments that seem to have come straight out of Monty Python (a bridge guard who multiplies every time you chop off one of his limbs) and you have this bizarre film that is neither a straight adventure nor exactly a spoof. It suffers from an overly episodic structure, but it benefits from Sandahl Bergman and Quin Kessler as the two muscular, beautiful Amazon warriors who are as proficient with a sword as with any other weapon. Both actresses are perfectly cast and do their roles justice, capturing the right ""always-ready-for-a-fight"" mentality. How anyone can give this film a ""1"" when there are, at the very least, these two amazing women to look at is beyond me! (**)"
3,tt0090009,/review/rw0226626/?ref_=tt_urv,"I must say that I am starting an unfortunate career of following Sandahl Bergman flicks.  Don't get me wrong...I've enjoyed what I've seen of Ms. Bergman's acting in Hell comes to Frogtown and in this film She(the book is interesting by the way). As long as you're not looking for anything special it's cool. I personally enjoyed it but I was lynched by the 3 friends I made watch it with me.  Especially since the whole movie we were waiting for the plot to resemble anything that the back of the movie box.  It never did.  There was supposed to be this whole plot about the all powerful ""She"" falling for a man who might kill her.  As far as I can tell there was a woman...who was generally referred to as ""She""...and indeed there was a lead male character. But they never so much as looked at each other crosswise.  But hey the real reason to watch the movie is ghouls, the god ""She""(who has no powers as far as I can tell), the other god they meet who actually has powers and wants to ""study"" our heroine, the weird dividable guy(my fav)...it's a labyrinth of weirdness.  I dug it."
4,tt0058379,/review/rw0086251/?ref_=tt_urv,"Godzilla Vs Mothra,the fourth Godzilla film,is regarded by some fans as the best. It doesn't have the power and allegorical elements of the original,yet it doesn't go into outright camp like many of the sequels. The film is colourful,exciting and often witty,yet the fantastical story is handled relatively seriously."
5,tt0058379,/review/rw1397673/?ref_=tt_urv,"As a major fan of the original dark, haunting kaiju movies, I very much enjoy watching ""Godzilla vs. Mothra"" even though I still can't understand why they call Mothra ""the Thing"" (maybe it's just in the Americanized dubbed version)."
6,tt0058379,/review/rw2050123/?ref_=tt_urv,"One of the top G-films most definitely, probably one of the best out of not just the Showa series, but the whole franchise. Its number three on my personal top ten Godzilla film list, right after ""Godzilla vs. Destroyah"" and ""Gojira"". I think it's a great work of classic cinema in general not just as a Japanese giant monster movie. It was the last film before Godzilla began his transformation into a hero and worse in the 70s a child star. It wouldn't be for another 20 years, in 1984's Return of Godzilla"", that the Monster King would go back to his roots. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy some of those films, after all I highly enjoy ""Terror of MechaGodzilla"", and I absolutely adore ""Ghidorah The 3-Headed Monster"" and ""Destroy All Monsters"". But none of those have the effect of this one. Firstly, it was for the most part realistic and didn't have any ridiculous story lines like latter Godzilla films (like ""Godzilla vs. Gigan"" and ""Godzilla vs. Megalon""). Plus it didn't involve aliens (not that I mind that. It's just that after 1968's ""Destroy All Monsters"", it becomes too often a part of the story). The plot is excellent work and the human characters I found entertaining. One of the best parts of the film is when the moral of the movie is exposed as Kenji Sahara's character tries to get away with the money after shooting his supposed business partner Kumayama (played by Yoshibumi Tajima) in the back in cold blood. However, his clean-getaway is inadvertently ruined by Godzilla, who in turn kills him. Director Honda was a World War II veteran, and abhorred violence, and yet we clearly see when Kumayama is shot in the head. It's a graphic type of violence rarely seen in the early films, though shoot outs would become common in the late 60s and 70s era G-films."
7,tt0058379,/review/rw0086245/?ref_=tt_urv,"This is one of the best Godzilla movies ever filmed. This sci-fi flick contains two of Toho Studios' most popular monsters, Godzilla and Mothra, and they come face-to-face in one huge battle. Mothra's egg has been washed ashore in Japan from Infant Island after a hurricane. A greedy businessman claims the egg and the natives of Infant Island desperately seek the egg in return, before it hatches! And, just when you don't need him, Godzilla appears and begins a spree of destruction. This movie has a strong and solid plot, which blends itself in the story very well. There are a cast of bright and delightful characters. Akira Takarada, Yuriko Hoshi, Hiroshi Koizumi, and the Peanuts delivered good on-screen comprehension. And, the US version with the English dubbing is pretty spot on. Ishiro Honda directed a terrific movie and Shinichi Sekizawa gave us an inspiring story. Akira Ifukube composed a beautiful music score, especially his score for the Shobijin, Mothra's Tiny Twin Priestesses. The battles between the monsters and the military are spectacular. This movie is not just another monster-on-the-loose movie, but a film with a message about the consequences of greed and environmental dangers. This is a must-see for any Godzilla fans or merely sci-fi fans in general."
8,tt0058548,/review/rw2191403/?ref_=tt_urv,"This is certainly a consensus pick as one of the worst (if not the worst) movies ever made - and for that very reason I've always wanted to watch it. Now I have, and my suggestion to everyone is - lighten up. Yes, it's bad. The sets are dreadful - worse than you used to see on Saturday morning kids' shows. The special effects are weak - although to be honest I've seen worse portrayals of space flight. And the costumes are hilarious - especially the polar bear and the robot. But come on - you have to admit that there's a certain ""cuteness"" to the story of Martians coming to earth to kidnap Santa Claus so that he can bring happiness to their children. All the characters are pretty one- dimensional. There's good guys and bad guys and fun guys and kids from both Earth and Mars. No one gets particularly well developed. And then, of course, there's Santa. In all honesty, I thought John Call did a decent job as the jolly old man. In this age of high tech special effects and big budget movies there's no doubt that this looks pretty weak - and even by the standards of 1964 it was still pretty weak. But it's good fun, and for the fun alone I don't think it deserves its reputation as one of the worst movies ever. What's left to say, except - ""Hurray for Santy Claus!"" 4/10"
9,tt0058548,/review/rw3167135/?ref_=tt_urv,"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is a low budget kid's movie from the early 60's. It has a reputation as one of the worst movies ever made. But, similar to most such famously trashed films, it actually turns out to be nowhere near the worst of the worst. More accurately, this could be described as an enjoyable slice of cheese. Sure, its rubbish on several levels but it also happens to be memorable on several other levels."
10,tt0058548,/review/rw3589231/?ref_=tt_urv,BEWARE OF FALSE REVIEWS & REVIEWERS. SOME REVIEWERS HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW TO THEIR NAME. NOW WHEN ITS A POSITIVE REVIEW THAT TELLS ME THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE MOVIE. IF ITS A NEGATIVE REVIEW THEN THEY MIGHT HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST THE FILM . NOW I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 200 HOLIDAY FILMS. I HAVE NO AGENDA. I AM HONEST
11,tt0058548,/review/rw1067639/?ref_=tt_urv,"Maybe I have a soft spot somewhere in my heart for poorly written, badly conceived, silly 1960s children's movies - but I really can't understand why Santa Claus versus the Martians is in the worst 100 movies of all time here on IMDb. Sure, most viewers will breathe a sigh of relief when it ends, but this film really seems downright harmless compared to the six month old Kennel Ration Hollywood has been feeding us as commercial film for the last ten or so years. Hey, at least it's not a remake, a sequel, or a 2 hour long CGI cartoon with a few human faces tossed in for effect."
12,tt0056142,/review/rw1021409/?ref_=tt_urv,"Any insults and accusations hurled against this beloved movie will fall on deaf ears with me. Admittedly, I am somewhat biased in favor of this entertaining monster romp because it was a regular television staple all during my childhood while I was growing up. It's one of the most enjoyable giant monster movies Toho Studios ever made, and it's certainly one of the best Godzilla films of all. It can be silly, it can be jokey, and it's also a hell of a lot of fun."
13,tt0056142,/review/rw0077751/?ref_=tt_urv,"Godzilla escapes from an ice berg and King Kong is found on an island that has lots of kick ass berries on it which the natives grind into a juice for Kong to drink. After throwing boulders at a giant octopus and drinking the juice, Kong falls asleep and the local Japanese TV guys ""ape nap"" him and bring him back to Japan so their boss can exploit the big monkey for all he's worth. But en route, the Japanese government order the TV guys to send Kong back his home island because they've got enough problems with Godzilla as it is, they don't need a giant monkey on the rampage as well. Kong escapes and this leads to the inevitable clash of titans as Godzilla battles Kong for the right to demolish Tokyo."
14,tt0056142,/review/rw0077718/?ref_=tt_urv,"This movie was the most profitable of the Godzilla series. He battles King Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World. The battle is like one between a wrestling match. The crunching and crushing of buildings are a work of special effects genius by Eiji Tsuburaya and Akira Ifukube gave a moving and super music score, introducing one of his familiar Godzilla themes that would be later heard in the many Godzilla movies that follow. "
15,tt0056142,/review/rw2048924/?ref_=tt_urv,"One of the biggest hits of all time ,""King Kong vs. Godzilla""!! Well, Toho style. Seriously, this is the highest grossing G-film ever, of course due to Godzilla's equally popular foe. or the third installment, all four fathers were brought in: Ishiro Honda (director), Tomiyuki Tanaka (producer), Eiji Tsubaraya (SFX) and Akira Ifukube (composer). Hauro Nakijima returns to play Godzilla, as he would until ""Godzilla vs. Megalon"" in 1973. but the screenplay was provided by the man who would do so for another eight films: Shinchi Sekizawa. I think he did a great job, and Godzilla still isn't a hero here, but the villain. Yes!!! Cutie Akikko Wakabayashi stars, along with Jun Tazki and other notable G- actors and the performances are excellent. The first new version of Godzilla appears, looking more reptilian and having lost the distinctive ears. A fantastic suit with an excellent heat ray. Kong, well let's just say that I always thought his face needed a good plastic surgeon. Plus the weird floppy arms, but overall the suit isn't terrible (just barely decent enough to get the job done). This one is one of my favorites due to the action. As a young child, and to this day, I love it! Godzilla's entrance is probably one of the coolest ever, debunking the notion of him always emerging from the sea. His rampage scenes are well done and Tsubaraya knew what he was doing. Kong and Godzilla's first meet was exciting but I never liked how the ape attacks Tokyo instead of Godzilla. "
16,tt0235608,/review/rw3330737/?ref_=tt_urv,"Batgirl is a rich woman that fights crime disguised with a mask in order to hide her secret identity. OK, you know that story, it's the same as Batman's. Indeed, her mask, cloak and car are very similar to the ones that Adam West wears and uses in the classic TV series. Though, this Batgirl is neither Barbara Gordon, commissioner Gordon's daughter, nor any other heroine created by DC Comics. This one is a Mexican pro wrestler! You can call her ""Mujer Murciélago"", ""Bat Woman"" in Spanish. Few people knows the true identity of this marvelous crime fighter who lives in Mexico City and works as a special agent for the police. As many luchadores are being mysteriously murdered in Acapulco, local police calls a special agent who contacts her as a partner to solve the case. Off course this is not a great film and does not have an innovative plot, but it is certainly not bad either. As a matter of fact, it is not very different from the stories of Batman's adventures from the 60's, as it is intended to get a ride in its success, although it is much less campy than Batman & Robin series or feature movie from that decade. In Mexican ""La Mujer Murciélago"", there is an archvillain who is a mad scientist with a dire laugh who lives in a yacht called Reptilicus - very cartoonish, isn't it? Guess what is the name of his assistant: Igor, the same used in many Frankenstein films! During the movie, the mad scientist, Dr. Williams, acquires a Two-Face appearance while fighting Batgirl, but not the coin-flipping craziness. While analyzing this movie, it is unavoidable to mention that Maura Monti, the Italian actress who portrays the heroine with big breasts and long eyelashes, is extremely beautiful. Unsurprisingly, there is some exploitation in the movie, showing her in bikini very often - yes, a masked Batgirl in bikini! -, but at least there are no nude or sex scenes, which are common in sexploitation B movies. The masked heroine, besides her wrestling skills, is also a super athlete and a diver. She also has gadgets and is very clever, like Adam West's Batman, being able to find solutions unrelated to her fighting and athletic abilities. Among the movie's flaws, I may mention that soundtrack is very bad and acting is not the most inspired. Piscis, the amphibious monster created by Dr. Williams, is quite ridiculous (though, not more than the monsters from Japanese ""tokusatsu"" and ""super sentai"" TV shows), basically a red version of the Sleestak from ""Land of the Lost"". The stuntwoman in the wrestling scenes has a very different body from Maura Monti, not convincing that she is the same person, in spite of the face being hidden by the mask. And the last but not least: come on, it is nonsense that a super heroine screams and faints in panic when she sees the monster (who she had already known!)! The final scene is also silly and sexist, but the film is overall amusing, much better than one may initially expect."
17,tt0235608,/review/rw0706935/?ref_=tt_urv,This is one strange little movie.Happened to pick up an english subtitled version of this one.It is known as Batwoman and was released during the Batman craze.Somehow DC comics didn't sue for the use of the name. Maybe because it was never really released in the USA.
18,tt0235608,/review/rw5858067/?ref_=tt_urv,"Yes, there was already Jerry Warren's The Wild World of Batwoman back in 1966, but now Rene Cardona is on the job. Yes, the same man who made Santa Claus and Night of the Bloody Apes, so you know that this movie is going to be chock full of completely baffling plot points, lots of surgery scenes and no short amount of lucha libre."
19,tt0235608,/review/rw8280405/?ref_=tt_urv,"Greetings And Salutations, and welcome to my review of The Batwoman; here's the breakdown of my ratings:"
20,tt3522806,/review/rw3536866/?ref_=tt_urv,"Apparently Hollywood is completely out of ideas. How else to explain this film? You have a ""retired"" assassin/sniper/martial arts master who is living a quiet life, and doesn't want to be called back into service. A government agent/former friend/former enemy blackmails/coerces him into returning to do some evil deeds, but he will be killing evil doers/assassins/nasty government types so he can stay a hero. Along comes a pretty girl that gets sucked into the plot, they fall in love/have sex/exchange witty barbs, and before long her life is in peril. The hero stabs/shoots/kicks/hangs/blows up and otherwise creates mayhem, and no one else in his path can shoot, throw a knife, or otherwise match his skills. Lots of stuff gets blown up and lots of people get killed, and it all takes place in exotic locations. The hero and the girl get together in the final scene."
21,tt3522806,/review/rw3665365/?ref_=tt_urv,"This film tells the story of an invincible international assassin, who is forced to kill three targets who are very hard to get near, and very heavily protected. If he doesn't look these people within a certain time frame, his female acquaintance will be in danger."
22,tt3522806,/review/rw3584513/?ref_=tt_urv,"Jason Statham's ""mechanic"" character named Bishop is called out of a peaceful retirement in Rio de Janeiro when an old adversary blackmails him into accepting three high-risk ""assignments."" The film is well-paced with well-choreographed action sequences. Jessica Alba is good as the romantic interest, a sensitive humanitarian who is being held hostage by the film's villain named Crain."
23,tt3522806,/review/rw7090025/?ref_=tt_urv,"The story makes zero sense. The disregard for basic logic such as geographical distances or a woman not wearing the same dress for 3 days just went too far. The swimming pool is awesome, we see the mechanic showing off his swimming and diving skills, but boy, was that a dumb movie. The love story is very forced. The characters are so cliche. And the action ultimately underwhelming."
24,tt2334879,/review/rw3425413/?ref_=tt_urv,"WHITE HOUSE DOWN is a film with myriad problems. It's directed by Roland Emmerich for once, a guy known for his less than stellar effects films like 2012 and GODZILLA, although once in a while he makes something like INDEPENDENCE DAY to make up for the bad stuff. It has some terrible CGI effects of helicopters in particular. It's a 12 certificate movie, which means that although violent it's not realistically violent. It's overlong. Channing Tatum, despite being a hot property in Hollywood, is wooden beyond belief. And, as with many Hollywood blockbusters, the writers have to shoehorn one of those annoying teenage characters into the storyline."
25,tt2334879,/review/rw2921261/?ref_=tt_urv,"I'll never fully understand why people flock to films like ""Iron Man I-III"" and then completely ignore a fun action film like ""White House Down"". After reading so many bad reviews, I started watching Emmerich's latest noise-opera only because I wanted to get tired enough to go to bed. I had planned to watch the first 5 minutes and to then fast forward through the rest of the film and have a quick look at the expensive special effects. Never did I expect to actually enjoy myself - and yet I did. In fact, I enjoyed myself so much that I couldn't stop watching for the entire 2 hours, and I didn't even get up to go to the bathroom. Right from the start I realized that this movie doesn't take itself too seriously and that this is Emmerich having fun (destroying the White House - if you count freezing it - for the fourth time). But despite all the silliness and the tongue-in-cheek moments, this is a suspenseful ride which never lets up and kept me hooked the entire time. There are quite a few unexpected twists and turns along the way, and the wonderful supporting cast (James Woods, Richard Jenkins and Jason Clarke, to name a few) keep even the most clichéd characters fun and interesting. So my verdict: Great, silly, cheesy action film! Suspend your disbelief and you will have one hell of a good time. I rate it 7 out of 10."
26,tt2334879,/review/rw2825429/?ref_=tt_urv,A bunch of terrorists attack and (way too easily) occupy the White House. Cale (Channing Tatum) is there with his 11 year old daughter Emily (Joey King). Through circumstances Cale saves President Sawyer (Jamie Foxx) from being killed and they try to figure a way to beat the terrorists and save the White House.
27,tt2334879,/review/rw7960963/?ref_=tt_urv,"Interestingly, in a space of just three months, 2013 saw the release of two films with the same premise: 'White House Down', and 'Olympus has Fallen'. Which one did you enjoy more?"
28,tt0092675,/review/rw3383096/?ref_=tt_urv,"Bloodsport (1988) is my favorite action Van Damme movie. It was the first movie I ever saw about Van Damme that introduced me in to his movies. This is the film I grew up with it, I have first see it, when I was 8 years old! I love this movie to death! In my opinion is Van Damme's best martial arts film! Beside Hard Target, Bloodsport is one of his best movies till date. I Love it so much. Best martial arts movie, is never boring, is fast and entertaining and It is awesome seriously. And I still love it today, Bloodsport also introduced me in to martial arts. Jean Claude Van Damme's Bloodsport is still today it's best. After this movie there were a few copycat movies that copy the idea from this movie. Like were Bloodfight (1989) with Bolo Yeung returning, with the same name, but playing different character from the Bloodsport and Bloodfist (1989) with World Kickboxing champion Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson. I also love the music from this movie lately it helps me a lot the song ""On My Own - Alone"", I also love the song ""Fight to Survive""."
29,tt0092675,/review/rw4893232/?ref_=tt_urv,"When it debuted, ""Bloodsport"" was to have been a story of the famed martial artist and miltary hero, Frank Dux. According to Dux, he won the ultra-secret 'Kumite'...a no holds barred martial arts international competition. He also was a top secret operative for the military and went on all sorts of scary missions in various countries. Unfortunately, pretty much none of Dux's claims turned out to be true! However, I assume no one other than Dux knew it at the time AND the star of ""Bloodsport"", Jean-Claude Van Damme, was no phony--having been a very accomplished full-contact fighter with championships to his credit. So, while the story turns out to be a load of crap, you cannot fault Van Damme and it's among his best films."
30,tt0092675,/review/rw1079043/?ref_=tt_urv,"I had never seen a van Damme-movie before this one. And oh boy, I was surprised in a really positive way. The best thing about this movie is that it's from the 80's. That means really GREAT music, and in this movie, the music makes up a really magnificent atmosphere for the viewer through the whole film. Of course, the fighting is good. It's not just good, it's great. It was really exciting to see different fighting styles from all over the world. And Bolo Yeung did a really great job as the villain. He barely talks, but shows with his behavior that he is Mr. ruthless himself. The final fight with van Dammes trademark, the 360-kick, shown several times in slow motion, is a feast for the eye. Hong Kong is the location for the movie, and the city fits perfectly for it. Enjoy!"

32,tt0087998,/review/rw0214628/?ref_=tt_urv,"This movie has a bigger cult following than many might think, and I am proud to say I am part of it. I see this film in the ballpark of ""The Evil Dead"", ""Re-Animator"", ""Bad Taste"", and many other classics of splatter legend. I don't feel the need to criticize the acting (unless you count the first two hapless victims), and this is because this movie does what most movies don't with their characters: it makes them REAL people. The fantastic elements blend beautifully with the boring, frustrating mess of most people's everyday life. Still, this is a fun b-movie, which means instead of depressing us with the real-life stuff, it puts some humorous spins on it. The gore and creature FX are amazing. Don't let that R rating fool you, this is one HARD R, so those with weak stomachs need not apply. The creature FX I was amazed by most of all. I would love to know how they did this with such a low budget! Everything in this looks extremely vivid and real (with the exception of some amateurish backgrounds at the beginning and end that are obviously pictures somebody painted or whatever). Even the computer cartoons of ""Jurassic Park"" do not hold a candle to these creature FX in the least. This is definitely one of the greatest indie/sci-fi/horror/splatter films ever, and I do wonder why it hasn't got the kind of recognition that movies like ""Evil Dead"" have (no big-budget sequels maybe?). As for those who call ""Parasite"" a sequel to this, I don't get it. Not only is this a film far more superior to ""Parasite"" and was seemingly made by totally different people, there is absolutely no way to connect them unless you're talking genre-wise. ""Parasite"" is in the far-off future, this one's in the present. ""Parasite"" is about genetically engineered creatures, this one's about space aliens. This one has a sense of humor. ""Parasite"" doesn't. In any case, I love ""Return of the Aliens: The Deadly Spawn"" (no matter what title it's under) for it is the classic that ""Parasite"" should have been and much, much more."

34,tt0087998,/review/rw0214629/?ref_=tt_urv,"For some it's probably criminally easy to dismiss a movie like this just because of it's low budget, but ""The Deadly Spawn"" was somewhat of a cult-hit in it's day and it's easy to see why. The make-up-effects are quite good for a movie this cheap (reportedly it cost just $ 20,000 and ended up making millions), and writer/director Douglas McKeown actually takes time building characters before he lets them die gory deaths (moahahaha)."
35,tt0087998,/review/rw3849846/?ref_=tt_urv,"""The Deadly Spawn"" is a classic example of a horror flick made on a shoestring budget which is nevertheless worth watching due to the ingenuity of its creators."
36,tt0122037,/review/rw2175392/?ref_=tt_urv,"It's fair to say I've earned my stripes in regard to zombie movies. Through the course I've taken to delve deep into horror, I've seen countless titles given the highest honors to the lowest scum-of-the- earth production values cinema has ever witnessed. From A to Z grade, however, there stands a few shining stars that are worth discussing. ""The Dead Pit"" is one of these last glimmers of hope. Brett Leonard, the man responsible for both writing and directing 1992's ""The Lawnmower Man,"" made his directorial debut with this undead feature; he did a fine job in presenting it."
37,tt0122037,/review/rw4070598/?ref_=tt_urv,"THE DEAD PIT is a low budget zombie splatter movie given the high definition treatment by the Code Red DVD company. They've got their hands on the unrated version which is full of extra gore scenes including graphic scenes of brain surgery and the like. The setting is a creepy mental hospital where a mad doctor was entombed in the basement after doing illegal experiments on his patients. In the present day, an earthquake sees him released to carry on his crazy business once more. Sure, this low budget production is rough around the edges and highly cheesy, with ham acting throughout, but it's also quite amusing. The exploitation value is high, as evinced in a scene in which a woman is sprayed with a water hose which manages to rip off her top. She also spends half the running time running around in her underwear. The emphasis, however, is on the bloodshed and it flows quite freely here. There are slasher-style murders (seemingly inspired by DRILLER KILLER at times), zombie attacks, and the aforementioned mutilation and surgery. It's too cheesy to be affecting, but it is fun."

40,tt0069792,/review/rw0127481/?ref_=tt_urv,"As I watched this low budget film I came to realize that while it is exploitation, it's still a story of an angry man that deep down wanted respect from those close to him. The film starts out with a young kid in 1953 Harlem who makes money giving shoe shines and gets involved in a mob hit and is told to take a package to a building to a bad cop named McKinney (Art Lund). McKinney accuses the kid of stealing money from him and is beaten badly until he has a broken leg. Fast forward to the mid 60's and young Tommy Gibbs (Fred Williamson) is now a grown man and executes a mob hit on his own and tells a mafioso named Cardoza (Val Avery) that he's responsible and wants in with the mob and just wants to run an area in Harlem. He rises in power and has some important log books with all the information on important people on the take. He has a girl named Helen (Gloria Hendry) but doesn't have the sophistication to keep her. Finally the mob decides to get rid of him and now he's the target! This film was directed by Larry Cohen (It's Alive!) who is a veteran of low budget efforts and the film is benefited by his experience. The film is actually shot on location in Harlem and in several shots you can see people staring at the camera. Also, the Apollo Theater is seen as the camera pans the street. While this is another version of ""Little Caesar"" there is an aspect of the story that I found very well handled and it was the scenes where Tommy Gibbs is feeling betrayed and alone. One scene in particular that stands out is at his mothers funeral and he asks his father if he's all right. What adds to these scenes is the effective use of music that helps establish the mood of the film and these scenes in particular. The music is by James Brown and Barry DeVorzon. Even with limited funds and some poorly dubbed dialogue can't detract from the emotions in parts of this film. Fred Williamson is a former football player and his acting experience was very limited so his performance is even more impressive to watch. The guy has natural charisma on screen but he also shows that he can bare his emotions like any good actor. If you like these types of films than this is one of the classics of its genre. As much fun as it was to watch Williamson smear shoe polish on Lund and make him sing ""Mammy"" the film has more to offer than that. The scenes of Williamson's character feeling alone and betrayed along with the good music score are what make this film stand out from the others of its kind. Classic exploitation."

When he grows up, he becomes a hitman (Fred Williamson) working for the Italian mafia. When he steals accounting ledgers from the mafia, he becomes a powerful kingpin in Harlem, keeping the mobsters and the dirty police commissary McKinney (Art Lund) under his control. But his fall begins when he learns that his mistress Helen (Gloria Hendry) is betraying him with his best friend."
42,tt0069792,/review/rw2973738/?ref_=tt_urv,"This review's title obviously refers to a famous Julius Caesar quote, and personally I think the greatest thing about ""Black Caesar"" is the subtle title reference towards the great historical leader. I deliberately state ""subtle"" reference, because the name itself isn't mentioned anywhere throughout the entire film, but the similarities between protagonist Tommy Gibbs and the Roman emperor are clever and relevant. Tommy also builds his own way to the top; in this case the conquering of a mafia empire that quickly becomes as over sized, cluttered and unmanageable as the Roman Empire. His methods are also merciless and strategic, but he also gradually transforms into a dictator feared by his loved ones as well as the target of conspiracies and assassination attempts. I don't know about you, but I think it's quite an ambitious and intelligent concept for a supposedly simple and low-budgeted piece of 70's exploitation trash! That being said, I have to admit that I nevertheless expected even more from this blaxploitation classic. I'm certainly not an expert in this domain, but I've seen the most important ones (""Across 110th Street"", ""Ganja & Hess""), the most outrageously entertaining ones (""Foxy Brown"", ""Truck Turner"") and the passable ones (""JD's Revenge"", ""Blackenstein""). ""Black Caesar"" somewhat balances between the first two categories, as the script isn't solid enough to be important and not cool enough to be outrageously entertaining. Basically it's just Fred Williamson looking mean and shooting white mobsters in the chest so that he can take their place in the New York gangster hierarchy. During this process he abuses and scares off the people he initially wanted to protect, like his mother and childhood friend. The film features too many dull parts and repetitive sequences. Every conflict is solved with a bullet and end with a close up of a dead body covered in thick and bright red blood syrup. The most memorable sequences include the intro, with a teenage Tommy enrolling the criminal life, a virulent taxi/on foot chase in busy NY streets and a sadist final confrontation between Tommy and his nemesis. Other terrific elements for exploitation fanatics to enjoy are the swinging soundtrack (with James Brown's unique voice) and authentically raw and gritty set pieces. Williamson is excellent, of course, but Art Lund gives an even more impressive performance as the disgustingly corrupt cop McKinney. Larry Cohen's direction is uneven, but it was one of the first ventures of this multi-talented and versatile cult genius. There's a sequel entitled ""Hell Up in Harlem""."

So he murders a mobster in cold blood to ingratiate himself with a rival kingpin and for this is allowed to set up his own small operation in an unprofitable part of Harlem. What follows is a steady rise to power helped in great measure by his obtaining some ledgers which list all of the corrupt politicians and the payments made to them under the table. Now, as far as a ""blaxploitation film"" is concerned this one wasn't too bad. Fred Williamson performed decently enough but my main concern was that it seemed like the sum didn't equal the parts. To be more specific, there were some very good scenes but they weren't connected very well. All in all then it wasn't a bad film and those who enjoy movies in this genre might like this one too.

49,tt0099026,/review/rw2373292/?ref_=tt_urv,"I hadn't seen ""The Ambulance"" for quite awhile, but I had a good time re-visiting it and this was one of the first works I had seen of filmmaker Larry Cohen. It might not be one of Cohen's highly regarded pieces, but ""The Ambulance"" is a fun, gripping slice of paranoia with an injection of black humour. The concept is audaciously ludicrous and Eric Roberts' ham-fisted lead performance is full of energy (and lets not forget that hypnotic mullet when in motion), along with James Earl Jones small, but cynically meaty role as a rundown detective on the edge. Moving at a fast, uniformed tempo, Cohen's boldly tight direction never lets up (where he knows how to shoot on location for maximum effect) and his writing manages to stay one step ahead as you get pulled along for the dangerous ride with its engineered thrills. There always seems to be some sort of threat at every turn for Robert's character and this keeps it excitingly intense, if daftly over-the-top with comedic results. Especially its cheesy climax in a night club with some berserk ambulance driving and of course its irony-laced revelation that you won't see coming. Roberts' character sure didn't. The plot takes on a modern approach to its mad doctor formula, staying quite dark and full of mystery in the chase/or race to uncover the truth while also trying to convince people of the threat. Roberts' plays Josh Baker a comic book artist who one day goes about asking out the women of his dreams (a stunning Janine Turner) who he sees everyday out on the streets of New York. An incident sees her collapsing with Josh by her side and then a mysterious vintage ambulance appears and whisks her off. So he goes to one hospital after another with no such luck. He thinks there might just be more to it, as he uncovers and now he's running for his life with no one believing him there's a phantom ambulance kidnapping people. Eric Braeden is suitably clinical as ""the doctor"" that's behind the kidnappings and Megan Gallagher offers good support as a police officer we can trust. Red Buttons is enjoyably snappy and Cohen regular James Dixon shows up too."
50,tt0099026,/review/rw0278768/?ref_=tt_urv,"Larry Cohen has not been known for coherence in his pictures. As a writer, he is often excellent with creative twists and turns for every story. As a director, he is often sloppy and mostly leaves you disappointed, thinking that a great opportunity has been lost. In his movies major characters disappear without explaination and whole chunks of plot often seem to be missing. All the while you are thinking ""what a shame on such a good story!"". To my surprise, I found that ""Ambulance"" actually is held together quite neatly. No chop-chop editing this time. The plot runs amok here and there, but not damagingly so. It is amusing and suspenseful with spunky performances by Gallagher and Roberts and a really good one by Red Buttons. Some effort have been put into the action sequences and interiors. This movie, unlike many other Cohen-directed, actually looks like it had a budget. The pace never flags and even if the ending is no great shakes, it's satisfying. Nice score too."
51,tt0099026,/review/rw1521694/?ref_=tt_urv,"You can always count on at least one thing going into a Larry Cohen movie - and that's a good time. Cohen had already tackled rogue police officers before it came to this film with Maniac Cop, and thus he decided to make a film about a rogue ambulance. The Ambulance may not be Cohen's finest achievement; but its great lightweight entertainment, and I'm sure very few people that watch this film will regret doing so. Naturally, there's not a great deal of point to the proceedings, and Cohen seems keen to focus as much on entertainment value as possible, which is no problem if you ask me. The plot focuses on Josh Baker; a humble cartoonist who, one day, decides to try and charm a woman on the street. Tragedy strikes when she passes out, but everyone is reassured when an ambulance turns up. However, upon going to check on her at the local hospital, Josh finds that she isn't there - and further investigation makes him realise that there has been several people going missing, and it turns out that a fake ambulance with fake doctors and nurses is abducting people!

The car wreck scene was quite an exciting set piece, and the gore isn't too shabby either. Battledogs is not without its flaws though. There is some nice tongue and cheek humour in the script, but too much of the dialogue is cheesy, unnaturally flowed and not always fitting in certain scenes. There is also a rather make-it-up-as-you-go-along feel. The story is a mixed bag. The good news is, it didn't bore me particularly and the nods to King Kong, Free Willy and Day of the Dead original were nice; the bad news is, nothing comes out as original and the mix of sci-fi and horror is confused. Maybe it would help if those two elements individually worked, sadly they don't; it is not thrilling enough to be good sci-fi and it's not scary enough to be good horror either. And it is largely to do with the overall quality of the CGI, the poor suspense and how tame and uninventive the attacks seemed to be. I'd forgive the fact that the characters are overused stereotypes if anything interesting was done with them, but despite the efforts of the actors the characters never were developed or likable enough. And how inaccurately and poorly the military are portrayed is likely to get people even more infuriated, especially if they're part of the military themselves. In conclusion, not terrible or great. 5/10 Bethany Cox"

83,tt2457138,/review/rw4192556/?ref_=tt_urv,"BATTLEDOGS is another B-movie from The Asylum, but for a change it's not a rip-off of a Hollywood blockbuster, at least not that I can think of. Instead it's a typical sci-fi/action/horror cross-breed, with a breed of genetic werewolves erupting across a city during a zombie-like outbreak. What plays out is intensely predictable and altogether cheesy, with actors delivering their lines with maximum gravitas which ends up being somewhat ruined by the inclusion of cartoonish CGI to depict the wolves. Where this does get interesting is in the excellent casting; aside from the wooden leads like Craig Sheffer, we get Ariana Richards (of TREMORS and JURASSIC PARK fame) alongside Wes Studi, Ernie Hudson, and Bill Duke."

A malevolent alien force in the meteorite causes an enormous Caterpillar D9 bulldozer to come to murderous life and terrorize a small handful of construction workers. Director Jerry London, working from a compact script co-written by noted science fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon, relates the compelling story at a steady pace and maintains a grimly sober tone from start to finish. Moreover, the able cast all contribute solid performances: Clint Walker as stern, rugged foreman Lloyd Kelly, Carl Betz as stolid, cynical loner Dennis Holzig, James Wainwright as hale'n'hearty lug Jules ""Dutch"" Krasner, Neville Brand as grizzled veteran mechanic Chub Foster, James A. Watson, Jr. as the laid-back Al Beltran, and a very young and boyish pre-""Vega$"" Robert Ulrich as eager young turk Mark McCarthy. While the premise sounds admittedly silly, it's thankfully handled with admirable conviction and seriousness by the director and cast; the increasingly grim, tense and nightmarish atmosphere in particular prevents the whole thing from ever degenerating into laughable camp. The bulldozer makes for a genuinely fearsome and intimidating juggernaut. A pitched fight between the bulldozer and a huge shovel rates as a definite thrilling highlight. Terry K. Meade's polished cinematography and Gil Melle's nicely wonky'n'spooky score are both up to par. An enjoyable ""Duel"" variant."

The vengeful spirit of Ruby's murdered mobster lover Nicky Rocco (handsome Sal Vecchio) uses the body of Ruby's sweet and innocent mute daughter Leslie (an impressive almost wordless portrayal by Janit Baldwin) as a vessel to exact revenge from beyond the grave on the people who killed him. Director Curtis Harrington, working from an engrossing script by George Edwards and Barry Schneider, relates the absorbing story at a steady pace, offers a generous sprinkling of decent gore, adds a few neat touches of amusing macabre humor (a corpse gets stashed in a soda vending machine that pumps out the guy's blood), and does his customary expert job of creating and sustaining a supremely eerie and unsettling gloom-doom atmosphere. Moreover, Harrington brings a wistful and melancholy nostalgic sensibility to the material which kicks the picture up a few extra notches. The sturdy acting from the sound cast rates as another major asset: Stuart Whitman does well as Ruby's loyal and amiable longtime buddy Vince Kemper, Roger Davis contributes fine support as helpful parapsychologist Dr. Paul Keller, and comely flash-in-the-pan 70's exploitation film starlet Crystin Sinclaire vamps it up nicely as shameless stuck-up tramp Lila June. William Mendell's crisp cinematography makes excellent use of vibrant color and makes the most out of the misty swampland location. Don Ellis' moody score hits the shuddery spot.

Believe it or not I preferred this sequel to the original, only due to the faster pace and a more likable hero in Treat Williams. Williams is one of those versatile actors who can convince in action and convince in the role of being human. Treat Williams acts much like how a real teacher in real life would plus he seems willing to negotiate and make amends for his actions. Such as the scene where Williams offers to pay for the kid's radio that he threw out the radio. There are many good scenes that are quite well acted such as when Williams talks to the class and in all seriousness it works better than the original. Also another element I like is how the action is more under control and the movie develops a more serious take on the plot. Although the one line of which Williams says ""I've killed before but I try to not like it, so this is going to be a new experience for me"" Is a howler.

Abominable Snowman(aka Deadly Descent) is down there with their bad movies. The good news is that it is a long way from SyFy's worst, and it is certainly better than last year's Bigfoot. And there are a few decent things. Nicholas Boulton's performance is dramatically stern and intense which is in good keep with this type of genre. The reveal of the second creature was very effective also, and Zara Dimitrova is smoking hot. Sadly, that's pretty much it. The acting has been much worse with SyFy, but there is still the mix of blandness and over-compensating. If you're looking for Atanas Srebrev to elevate it, you'll be disappointed, he's only in one scene and that one scene completely wastes him. It is not the actors' fault though that their performances generally don't register. They also have to work with characters that do little more than bore and irritate you and dialogue that just doesn't flow and that is unintentionally funny. The story doesn't engage either, while it picks up a tad in the latter half it is slow-moving and has very little atmosphere. Any comedy is awkward and out of place, the scary elements are diluted by the lack of suspense and that we don't see a lot of the deaths(which weren't that inventive in the first place) and the drama is soppy and lacks any kind of passion. Visually, there's been worse, but the creatures look blurry and quite weird-looking and the editing lacks any kind of fluidity.

109,tt0070169,/review/rw3145023/?ref_=tt_urv,"This sequel to the popular blaxploitation hit ""Black Caesar"" was cheaply and hastily shot, and it shows. It is pretty obvious at times that star Fred Williamson wasn't always available, meaning that he's either doubled or his character simply doesn't appear at all in a scene. The low budget and speedy production also shows in other aspects, one being the screenplay. There isn't too much of a story here. Indeed, it seems at times writer/director Larry Cohen was making things up during the shoot. But despite the crude nature, the movie all the same kind of works. It is fast paced, and never boring. And Fred Williamson does manage to make his character magnetic enough that you keep watching him. Apparently audiences agreed, since this sequel was successful enough at the box office that the studio planned a third movie concerning the adventures of character Tommy Gibbs, but those plans were eventually cancelled."

That movie was a great success and in the rush to cash in with a sequel something was lost. Cohen was shooting his killer baby classic 'It's Alive' at the same time Williamson was making 'That Man Bolt', yet they still attempted to make 'Hell Up In Harlem' simultaneously! Cohen's script is weaker this time around and the emphasis is on fights (fists and guns) over character development and story. The movie is more of an action film than a crime drama and therefore much less interesting to me. Williamson is still a powerhouse, but the movie as a whole fails to satisfy. Gloria Hendry ('Black Belt Jones') and D'Urville Martin ('Dolemite') both return from the first movie but aren't required to do all that much. You could even call their roles cameos and not be far wrong. Julius Harris ('Superfly') also returns as Williamson's father, but this time round he has a much larger role, and almost carries the first third of the movie all by himself. The film directly follows on from 'Black Caesar' with Tommy Gibbs (Williamson) recovering from a near fatal gunshot wound. He relies upon his Pop to keep things together, and this enables Harris to blossom from a middle aged straight citizen into a cool dressing killing machine almost overnight! This is one of the most entertaining things about the whole movie, but not enough to stop it from being a disappointment. Even the score this time round is inferior, with no James Brown content. I think this movie was too rushed and suffers for it. It has its moments but isn't a patch on 'Black Caesar'. I've noticed that quite a few blaxploitation classics fail to deliver with their sequels (I'm especially thinking of 'Foxy Brown', Jack Hill's weak follow up to his sensational 'Coffy'). I wonder why that was? Greed perhaps, or lack of faith in the material, I don't know. Anyway, 'Hell Up In Harlem' is okay, but it could have been, SHOULD have been a lot better!

We have a story about some guy that goes around brutally killing young women and others and as a much smaller story - a psychic that is red-hot on his tail. Redhot? Cameron Mitchell plays the psychic and his presence is sorely needed for the film's credibility, yet he is barely in the picture. And yet, even though his character and dialog were quite ridiculous - especially what happens to him and the one-liner that follows - I thought he was the best thing in the picture. The demon is never explained at all in terms of why he is killing, why he is a ""demon"" if indeed he/it really is, or what any motivation is. He just likes killing with brutal coldness. Fortunately, the movie, filmed in England and with largely a British cast, is competently conceived in several ways. The acting rises above poor and is decent. The director - Percival Rubens who also wrote this nonsense - has some talent in creating some suspenseful scenes and a sense of tension. The scenes with the girl being chased in the house were fairly effective, despite the needless nudity. After awhile we got the point. But the script is just so awful and threadbare as to limit the film to anything other than garbled, ludicrous nonsense. At the very least, the film is watchable and will/should have you arching your eye brows trying to figure out what in the heck is going on.

To be honest, it's a pretty shoddy effort in many ways but it's definitely not without merits either. In some respects one of this movie's chief problems is also inadvertently one of its strengths. The issue in question is how confusingly structured it all is. Characters are linked together only via the killer, and he is, to put it mildly, very vaguely defined himself. So the film has a very disjointed feel to it. While I can't see this as having been intentional, it does have a strange dream-like effect where we have this weird pale-faced amorphous figure appearing at various times with no fathomable reason. The Demon himself is a decent villain, as he has a good air of mystery about him, partly due to the fact that he is given absolutely no history or motivation. He is masked like Michael Myers in a white faceless mask although this mask does seem to appear and disappear between shots which must surely qualify as a pretty monumental goof. His killing method is bloodless but unusual enough for some credit. Although quite honestly even if there were buckets of the red stuff you would be doing well to even notice seeing as the lighting in this production is terrible. Too many scenes are played in almost total darkness, so you only have an impression of what's going on. Fortunately, we are able to make out the finale which is a lengthy scene involving the Demon chasing a topless girl around a house – it's clichéd but this sort of stuff never really gets old. The only name actor is Cameron Mitchell who plays a psychic colonel who is helping track down the killer.

I definitely reckon their importance and influence, but personally I'm always much more entertained by their copious amounts of (primarily Italian) rip-offs. I can't help it Trashy titles such as ""Beyond the Door"", ""The Tempter"" or ""Demon Witch Child"" are just a lot more fun to watch because the atmosphere is a lot less demanding while the gore/bloodshed is a lot more outrageous. ""The Cursed Medallion"", also known as ""The Night Child"" theoretically also qualifies as such an Italian ""The Exorcist"" rip-off, but the overall tone of the film balances back and forth between the stern 1973 original and the over-exploitative other rip-offs. This one plays in one league higher thanks to three aspects: a surprisingly intriguing script with likable characters, solid direction by Massimo Dallamano and a downright fantastic – albeit ruminated – musical score by Stelvio Cipriani. Michael Williams and his 11-year-old daughter Emily are still recovering from the devastating loss of their wife/mother, who got trapped in her bedroom when a fire broke out and fell to her death from the window. Little Emily carries her mother's medallion – a gift from her father – everywhere with her. But Michael has to pick up work again and travel to Italy to make a TV-documentary about diabolical art. Following doctor's advice, Emily and the introvert nanny Jill accompany him. When there, Michael and his producer (and brand new love interest) Joanna stumble upon a truly sinister painting in the catacombs of an old castle, and there seems to be a connection between the painting and the medallion around Emily's neck. Fact is that the little girl behaves very strangely and dangerously jealous when it comes to her father. ""The Cursed Medallion"" deals with a lot more topics than just possession, like for instance reincarnation, the Electra complex and satanic relics. This is actually one of those rare Italian horror movies for which it's regrettable that they are simply just labeled as ""rip-off"", because it has a lot more to offer. ""The Cursed Medallion"" is so much better than most of its contemporary Italian companions and it's almost entirely the accomplishment of co-writer/director Massimo Dallamano. This criminally underrated director also made the single best giallo ever made (""What have you done to Solange?"") and was a brilliant cinematographer during most of his career. He shot some of Sergio Leone's best western classics, among others, and his talented eye for breath-taking camera compositions are also noticeable in this film; just check out the two separate sequences of ladies falling to their deaths. Dallamano also briefly appears in a funny cameo, as a random man at the airport.

Dallamano died in a car accident one year after the release of this film, at age 59, which is a crying shame as I'm sure he still had a couple of great movies left in him. One final remark about the awesome soundtrack by Stelvio Cipriani, because that is also one of the film's main trumps. Even though you could state that he often recycled his own previous work, Cipriani is definitely one of Italy's greatest composers, next to – of course – Ennio Morricone and Riz Ortolani."

It's certainly better than the much more famous ""Beyond the Door"", which also starred Richard Johnson. Actually,the term ""Exorcist"" rip-off is a more than a little unfair as these films were all quite different from ""The Exorcist"" (and each other). This film has a kind of subtle, supernatural atmosphere much more similar to Nicholas Roeg's ""Don't Look Now"" than to the visceral horror of ""The Exorcist"". There is also kind of an aura of evil in the film that goes beyond just the possession of the young girl and which anticipates ""The Omen"" or supernatural Dario Argento films like ""Inferno"", but with an additional reincarnation element (and, of course, a much more limited budget)."

The most notable thing about this film is definitely the killer's modus operandi. Most slashers simply feature some guy with a knife, but the killer in this film has decided to go a step further than that and had developed a way to use an ordinary telephone as a murder weapon! Obviously, the whole thing comes off as being more than a little bit silly, but the way that the murders are carried out is amusing enough. The plot centres on these murders and takes the form of an investigative thriller, as our hero, Nat Bridger, begins looking into the death of one of his students. The film is never really all that interesting, but at least it's not boring and there's usually another murder scene just around the corner anyway; though unfortunately, they are pretty much the same. Director Michael Anderson does manage some fairly good moments of suspense, a couple of major characters have close calls (no pun intended) when speaking on the phone and there are various other bits and bobs to keep us interested. I can't say that this is a brilliant film, but it's at least worth a look."
121,tt0081203,/review/rw1315831/?ref_=tt_urv,"""Bells"" looks like an average and routine 80's slasher but you should know to expect a little bit extra from the talented director of ""Logan's Run""; Michael Anderson. And indeed, only a couple of minutes into the film and already it turned out that my impressions and expectations towards this film were entirely wrong and I was in for a pleasant surprise. ""Bells"" isn't a teen slasher movie at all (despite the VHS cover art and the cheesy sounding alternate title ""Murder by Phone"") but a fairly well plotted thriller that even shows the ambition to question the reliability of gigantic enterprises and refer to government conspiracies. How many ""Friday the 13th"" rip-offs can righteously claim to have done that? Richard Chamberlain stars as university professor and environmentalist Nat Bridger who privately investigates the bizarre death of one of his former students. The poor girl turns out to be the first victim of a maniac who developed a method to kill people over the phone (!) by sending an extremely high level of voltage through the speaker. Don't ask me to explain the technical aspects, but the victims start to shake and bleed from eyes & ears before getting catapulted in the air by an explosion! Not exactly tasteful but original and very entertaining to look at! This killing modus operandi as well as the further development of the ""whodunit"" storyline is often very implausible and silly, but you easily look past these flaws simply because the pace is exciting and the suspense-sequences are extremely intense. The film's only real disadvantage is that the scenery has severely dated by now and that some of the observations in the script turned out very exaggerated (for example, the phone company tour guide's estimation that there will be 1.4 trillion phones by the year 2000). Perhaps, this even is a rare example of a horror film that would actually profit from a remake! I'm convinced that some of the nowadays scriptwriters can come up with nifty ideas when re-working this premise into a story that revolves on mobile phones, teleconference attributes or web cams. Class actor Chamberlain is adequate in the lead, but the best performances are delivered by Sara Botsford as his love-interest and Gary Reineke as the obnoxious police detective."

John Houseman also star in this Canadian film that was released a year earlier in Canada as BELLS, and released in U.S. as MURDER BY PHONE.  The American print is edited to 78 minutes as the Canadian print runs 95 minutes.  Roger Corman probably edited it to save money on the print stock when he picked it up for U.S. release.

Includes nice support from John Houseman as his crotchety mentor, whose amenable exterior may conceal ulterior motives. 'Bells' might seem to have an entirely implausible premise, but nonetheless manages to coalesce into an efficient, and highly entertaining, early 80s horror; which is lent considerable verisimilitude by Richard Chamberlin's earnest performance.

I've always been a great fan of Lieberman's work and I consider him an essential director for the cult-genre, even though he only made two really notable films (""Squirm"", the only creature feature revolving on killer worms and ""Blue Sunshine"", a splendid psychedelic drug-movie). Hopefully, this ""Satan's Little Helper"" will become his third cult classic within a few years! This is an outrageous satire, hilarious in case you have a morbid sense of humor but practically unendurable in case you exclusively swear by intelligently plotted films. During his rather long absence (he only made a couple of unnoticed TV-movies during the nineties), Lieberman apparently did a lot of observing, as his new screenplay is a spoof on many modern society issues such as video games, the spoiled youth, religion etc The story centers on a spoiled little brat who wastes most of his time by playing an immoral and violent video game called Satan's Little Helper. When he encounters a man dressed like Satan on Halloween's day, he thinks it's an act and he nearly begs this guy to assist him on his murder spree. Without realizing the seriousness of his crimes, young Douglas laughs at many violent massacres and he even introduces this personification of evil to his family. The plot sounds like a bunch of absurd nonsense  and actually, it is  but it's FUNNY nonsense! The comical effect is reached by the stupidity of the characters and  especially  by the portrayal of Satan! He doesn't speak but the mask he's wearing is great and his spontaneous reactions are hilarious. The ""gags"" in this film are pretty unethical (a cat is smashed against a wall, pregnant women & blind men are ran over by carts, intestines are being knotted) and I'm sure many people won't even grant this film the littlest smile. Too bad for them, because ""Satan's Little Helper"" is unique in its own peculiar way and certainly worth checking out for people with no morals. There's some nice acting to admire, too! Amanda Plummer (her face alone scares me) is good as the eccentric mother and the gorgeous Katheryn Winnick shines as the sexy sister.

Think of this as the ""B"" side to BAD SANTA - another seasonal black comedy that was as shocking as it was funny for totally abandoning any & all notions of being politically correct.

Cardos manages to create a reasonable amount of tension, stages the kill scenes with laudable restraint, and really delivers with the excitingly over-the-top grand payoff ending, a fiery, all-hell's-broken-loose, packs one hell of a bunch final face-off in which the rot-faced intergalactic ghoul turns many of L.A.'s finest pigs into smoking strips of crisp bacon by shooting laser beams from its eyes.

Most of the time pigs in popular culture are cute, funny, a term of insult, to a majority the word pig brings up a dirty, snuffling and shuffling pack of beasts in a farmers yard, waiting to get turned into delicious food. So to use pigs as a force for horror, to have them preying on humans, it's a good role reversal. Plus, the basic form of a pig doesn't take too much distortion and increase in size to become a pretty menacing looking customer. It was with these thought in mind that I sat down to Pig Hunt, unknowing that the pig action is actually just one aspect of the film, it being more of a backwoods genre mash up. The film sets about its build up during the course of a hunt, friends out for macho bonding in the forest (though one girlfriend tags along), a soaking, chilly trek with a few hints and rumours to stir a sense of mystery. Monster pig action is conspicuously absent for quite some time as the film combusts somewhere around the halfway mark, blazes through exciting hick-sploit action and some more unexpected craziness before we finally get into monstrous territory. Fortunately, the beast is mighty impressive, no CGI in sight, a tightly shot ferocious tusked beast rather worth the wait. A downside of all of this is that such a set up somewhat requires decent, memorable or likable characters and performances and Pig Hunt is pretty meh on the characterisation and acting fronts. No one is especially bad, but equally I never felt much for anyone. Travis Aaron Wade is a competent enough hero figure, Tina Huang does a fair tough gal schtick as his girlfriend, Howard Johnson Jr. makes for a decent a-hole, slightly more of a punch is provided by Jason Foster and Nick Tagas as wild natured but initially friendly hicks, while most notable is Les Claypool as a bulky, mystical figure who becomes important later on in the game. Though generally competent, the film suffers from a drawn out first half in which presumably we are supposed to get to know the characters so we can suffer and thrill along with them, but as mentioned they just aren't especially interesting. Slick, wet and vivid cinematography from Adam Kane makes for a suitably arduous atmosphere and when things do get exciting director James Isaac keeps tight, stylish hold on things, making for one or two impressive, thrilling moments. There's more nudity than might be expected, which is rather pleasing to behold, and a few good grisly scenes, the film isn't too concerned with gore but uses it for some nifty jolts. Interestingly, the goriest scene involves a pig rather than a human. Comment on the savagery of man? I could have done with more general gore, a shorter first half and longer final block (the film needs more pig!) but generally I was pretty pleased by this one.

It has everything that should be in a horror movie, some weirdos (like the ""redneck family neighbors"" or the ""hippie community"") and some strong characters like Jason Foster who sometimes visually comes up like a sort of ""badass"" Aragorn ( by the way Travis Aaron Wade and Tina Huang as main char's did a great job, too). The story has multiple threats what makes it more interesting than other films in this genre, it contains enough suspense, horror and gore (great job on the special FX even the mutant pig) and good action too! As there are many horror movies simply duplicating old ""hits"" this one does not come up with really something new, but it has enough potential not to see it as a copy of the older genre stuff because of his mixture of horror and monster movie.

Much racist abuse and humiliation, though this all gets reversed as the family regain the upper hand and the 'by the book' cop makes an exception and allows the revenge to run it's course. Vile, exciting, hateful and touching by turns this is a very unusual, though non the more likable piece of exploitation cinema.

The film definitely takes influence from Wes Craven's pioneering shocker, as well as the rest of the 'rape and revenge' genre, but by adding racist themes into the mix, director Robert A. Endelson instantly gives his film more scope and more potency, as rather than have the violence directed against one, or a group of people; it's directed against a whole race of people. The plot follows three inmates that escape from prison. While on the run from the cops, they decide to hole up in a house in the woods, inhabited by a family of black people. These convicts aren't very nice anyway, but their leader also happens to be an astute racist; and so decides to take out his frustrations on the captive family in the most brutal and humiliating ways possible."

It was good to see Cung Le and David Bautista in action, and particularly gratifying to see Chen Kuan-tai and Gordon Liu on hand; their inclusion (in addition to the on location locations) lent the proceedings a beautiful touch. Rza does a credible job as Thaddeus. It'll be interesting to see what happens in the sequel (a Kwai Chang Caine return to America to find his mother, played by Pam Grier...?). Lucy Liu as the queen of the Black Widows also deserves mention. Action-wise, it's often over the top, but not in the ridiculously bad way so many contemporary martial arts action scenes are (the spinning kick that decapitates one guy was just plain kung fun, damn it).

172,tt0056601,/review/rw0079697/?ref_=tt_urv,"While 'Donovan's Brain' wasn't the first movie version of Curt Siodmak's sci fi shocker, it is by far the best known and best remembered of the three adaptations (so far). As a corny but entertaining b-grade movie it is hard to beat, and wonderful fun.  'The Brain', an overlooked German/English remake, doesn't try to outdo it, it instead approaches the source material in a very different way. The sensationalistic thrills and mind control horror of the 1953 movie are replaced by a calmer, more atmospheric style which adds a mystery element not seen in the earlier version. The basic premise is the same (though the names have been changed). This time around the scientist experimenting with keeping monkey's brains alive outside the body is played by Peter van Eyck ('Wages Of Fear'). He is assisted by his beautiful wife (well, I think it's his wife) Ella (Ellen Schwiers, who is positively stunning, and a lot easier on the eye than Nancy Davis!), and his trustworthy alcoholic sidekick (Bernard Lee, 'M' of James Bond fame). Once again a plane crashes nearby and the sole survivor is taken back to their lab. Once again the man cannot be saved but the scientist decides to keep his brain. As in 'Donovan's Brain' the brain survives and begins to exert control over the scientist. But it isn't in the same way, it is much subtler, and instead of domination, the brain wants something else - justice. For in 'The Brain' the millionaire has been murdered, and most of his family and associates are suspects. This interesting twist, plus the superior cast, makes this movie a rarity - a worthwhile remake. However, I wouldn't go so far as to say it surpasses the earlier movie. It is less silly and more intelligent, but not necessarily more entertaining. I enjoy both movies in different ways, and recommend them both."

It was about parkour n very entertaining. I saw Night fare recently without watching the trailer or reading much about it. I was pleasantly surprised how good the movie was n was shocked too knowin that it is the same director of Yamakasi. Looking forward for his future projects, specially a film which has Orlando bloom in it called Smart Chase. Coming back to Night fare, well it's a solid thriller with good pace n decent acting. The camera work was good n the cinematography was done very well . The music was done well too especially whenever the 'Maniac' approaches. It had a sense of dread n tension to it. This movie reminded me of ol skool 80s slasher, where a maniac keeps on chasing its victims. Remember Maniac cop? The kills were fast n brutal. The killer was scary n solidly built. It had a feel of Duel, Joy ride -1, Jeepers creepers. The length of the movie was short. Ther is only one small complain. When the guy with the sword comes down to confront the Maniac, he's suddenly taken down on the ground. I mean that scene looked too fake man. There is enuff kills to satisfy horror fans. Even the offscreen violent scene ( The man with the dog scene) was terrifying enuff. Some people might complain about the ending being lame or maybe some may not understand because it's in French. Slick thriller pulsing with a fantastic score. Night Fare is a tense and, at times, brutal chase flick that keeps the adrenaline pumping throughout. Don't miss the ride."

After coming to the realization that this was a graphic novel come to life (and the last 30 minutes proved me right), I just sat back and enjoyed it.

182,tt3889166,/review/rw4087348/?ref_=tt_urv,"I'm pretty sure that the makers of ""Night Fare"" got some inspiration from the 1984 American movie ""The Terminator"", since the first two-thirds of the movie for the most part involve two protagonists constantly running away from a pursuing and unstoppable threat. But taking inspiration from another movie doesn't really bother me as long as the makers of the new version execute things well, and for the most part the movie is pretty well made. There is a good deal of tension and excitement in the first two-thirds, as well as some good action and brutality. I admit that eventually the movie starts to get a little repetitive, but fortunately around that time, the movie changes things around and we get another plot thread. This new plot thread is interesting, but by the time we get to the closing credits, you'll realize that the movie has not answered a number of key questions. And some plot points feel unfinished as well. Despite these flaws that I have described, the movie is never dull and is always entertaining. And at just 80 minutes in length, it certainly does not overstay its welcome. A word of warning if you watch the movie on Netflix: Watch it with English subtitles, because a significant portion of the dialogue is in French."

He creates a truly bad science fiction film with amazingly poor special effects and some of the schlockiest character acting performances and dialogue around.  Supposedly based on a story by H. G. Well's, The Empire of the Ants is about how a group of people go to one of those shin-digs put on by real estate folks hoping you will buy some of their resort property after drinking some of their third-rate drinks and eating some of their crummy snacks.  Joan Collins is running the show, hoping to sell all the people who came by boat to her real estate project a lot.  Seems she is not a wholly reputable businesswoman, yet she has no knowledge of the fact that giant ants that grew from a leaking can of nuclear waste have taken over the resort and begin feeding on her guests, first in pairs.  In one of the more ridiculous scenes in the film, giant ants run on the dock, jump on the boat, attack one of the crew, and then cause the skipper, hardily played by Robert Lansing, to set fire to the ship and leave the survivors no recourse but to trek back by foot.  The journey back causes lots of death and destruction.  The most ridiculous scene in the film has an aged couple hiding in a cabin and then coming out to see these giant ants all over the hut and on the ground standing.  I almost fell over laughing at the awful special effects!  Finally, the remaining few reach a town that secretly has been taken over by giant ants that spray a mist over people and make them do their bidding.  The second half of the film breaks any possibility that you take the film seriously.  The first half, although filled with many a ridiculous moment, at least has some suspense and gives the actors a little screen time to show that some of them actually know how to act.  The second half is a hodge podge of poor script-writing, bad character acting, and some more real cheesy special effects.  The film is another testament to Mr. BIG's ability to create some of the campiest, bad sci-fi around.  Despite all this negativity, the film is a load of unintended laughs!"

186,tt0075989,/review/rw0979914/?ref_=tt_urv,"An eminent intro with a neat voice-over makes us aware that ants actually are as sophisticated as humans (if not more sophisticated). This is the perfect introduction to one of the most grotesque creature-features ever unleashed upon horror cinema. Bert Gordon's Empire of the Ants, ladies and gentlemen! In this story, supposedly adapted from an H.G. Well's tale, the ravishing Joan Collins stars as a fancy estate agent who tries to sell island properties to a bunch of phonies pretending they have money. The joy is barbarically interrupted by a colony of humongous ants! The monstrous bugs have mutated into unearthly beings due to toxic waste (figures). EofA is often categorized as one the worst 70's shlockfests, partly because it's from the hand of Gordon. But try to look at it as pure fun and cult entertainment that doesn't require brain activity. It's a troop of hairy, over-sized and  especially  cheaply created ants eating people one by one. Nothing more, nothing less. Still, the island location is eerie and the sound effects are more or less decent. Joan Collins, one of my personal favorite actresses, is great as the bitchy broad. The rest of the cast are stereotypes, like the loser turned hero, the old wise guy the egocentric coward (who nearly always dies spectacularly) and the cute babe. I hardly consider the overuse of all these clichés to be obstacles since I never expected to see a masterpiece to begin with. The only real crap elements are the weak dialogs and the complete lack of atmosphere and tension. Empire of the Ants does feature a brilliant, typical B-movie twist near the end, though. But that's just my opinion and I'm sure that most people will find it too stupid for words. Nevertheless, Empire of the Ants is a must-see if you're in to ""big bug""-movies. This sub-genre of horror is going through a revival these days and it's essential to watch the influential gems that once started it all. Also recommended: ""Tarantula"", ""The Bees"", ""Frogs"", ""Phase IV"" (more ants), ""Kingdom of the Spiders"" and ""The Deadly Mantis""."

The plot has these people looking at vacation plots...you know timeshare stuff. While touring the facility, some members disappear and then the ants attack. They have to get away from them and go down a river on a boat to do so. This is my favorite part of the movie, going down the river. Lots of the cast are taken out here.

Graphic gore, gratuitous nudity, red herrings, horrendously bad dialogue and gaffs galore this is a bad movie. But it's also an immensely enjoyable one. I like it so much that I own it on pre cert VHS, have 3 copies on DVD and will probably also purchase on BR. I just don't tire of watching it.

Notorious, for being on the UK's video nasty list, gorehounds will not be let down by this crazy and somewhat quirky 80's slasher. A killer is on the loose at a Boston,Mass area college brutally killing and mutilating gorgeous college girls to get body parts to put together a human jigsaw puzzle. For the most part, the overdubbing and acting is atrocious(with the exception of Christopher George as a police detective, who actually is really great in this), there are slow parts and subplots that go nowhere. But, I digress Pieces delivers huge as trashy grindhouse entertainment, with tons of nudity and some spectacular state of the art gore. Gore galore, with lots of boobage and 80's bush, Pieces will please fans of sleazeoid cinema and ultra violence. Add Bluto from the Robin Williams live action Popeye movie as groundskeeper and a cameo of Bruce Le showing his kung fu, you have an odd, but effective splatter film that is very over the top and cool low budget horror flick."
206,tt0082748,/review/rw0187458/?ref_=tt_urv,"'Pieces' is a wonderfully entertaining trashy slasher movie. Dumb, but lots of fun. It has impeccable exploitation credentials - directed by the guy who gave us 'Slugs - The Movie' and co-written by both Dick Randall (assorted kung fu and Emanuelle movies) and shlockmaster Joe D'Amato, director of the legendary 'Antropophagus'(a.k.a. 'The Grim Reaper') to name the most notorious of his 150+ movies. Plus the star is Christopher George ('The Exterminator', Fulci's 'City Of The Living Dead'). George plays a cop sent in to investigate some bloody slayings on a college campus (the movie is Spanish but tries to pretend it's American). The viewer knows the killer is obsessed with female bodies and there is a recurring motif involving jigsaws and mirrors. As in most slasher movies there are plenty of suspects to choose from, including a scary looking gardener (cult favourite Paul Smith, 'Midnight Express', 'Crimewave'), a Professor of Anatomy (Jack Taylor, who appeared in a few Jess Franco classics like 'Succubus' and 'Eugenie'), and the Dean (Edmund Purdom, 'The Fifth Cord', 'Ator'). The lovely Lynda Day (Christopher George's wife) plays an undercover tennis coach(!) and spaghetti western veteran Frank Brana is George's sidekick. If you approach 'Pieces' with the right frame of mind you'll have a hell of a good time. It's bloody, completely illogical and contains the most unexpected martial arts scene in the history of horror movies (yeah, I know...)"

Somehow, when it comes to fiction, the clichés take over, and this film, with some genuinely gorgeous camera-work and impressive stunts, is full of them. The wealthy megalomaniac determined to conquer K2 at any cost, the climber who lost his nerve when his father was killed who pushes himself into action to save his sister, stuck in a crevass high up the mountain with the moneyed one, the bitter old man of the mountains who is essential to the rescue, the guide who has sold out, It's all there.

So expectations are generally pretty low when a new one comes around the block. This rule of thumb applies to The Rezort. But I have to say that this one keeps things a little more interesting than usual. The set-up about a high-tech resort where adrenaline mad tourists can visit to shoot zombies is a pretty good new angle for the genre; even if it essentially borrows heavily from Michael Crichton penned sci-fi classics Westword (1973) and Jurassic Park (1993), especially when we have the zombies breaking free and causing all manner of horrors on the humans in a very similar way to what the androids and dinosaurs did in those two earlier films. Still, I didn't really mind this derivative aspect very much as at least it seemed – to me at least – to be a new angle for the zombie film."

216,tt0059474,/review/rw0090183/?ref_=tt_urv,"Motor Psycho wasn't exactly the Russ Meyer film I was hoping to see. Not that it's a bad movie  far from it  but it lacks the eccentric character of his other work. Motor Psycho is a raw drama about delicate topics such as rape, murder and revenge. The plot involves a battle between vets! A veterinarian's wife is raped by 3 relentless bikers (one of them being a Vietnam-veteran) and he goes after them, accompanied by a busty lady who has been widowed by the same gang. Normally, Meyer's films are a feast for all sensesthere's always something extravagant to discover or admire. Compared to that, Motor Psycho is pretty lame and it merely depends on two ultra-strong sequences and a delightful breast-parade (even though all female flesh remains covered).  The sequence in which protagonist Alex Rocco forces his female companion to suck a snake's poison out of his leg is brilliant and so is the grotesque finale in which the main villain (Stephen Olivier) revives his Vietnam trauma's. I'd recommend the film for those parts alone! If you're a fan of the director's personal style, I advise you to check this film outIt won't take much of your time anyway, since the film only last a good 70 minutes."
217,tt0059474,/review/rw1507553/?ref_=tt_urv,"Motor Psycho is pretty much your typical Russ Meyer film, and features all of his trademarks. We've got busty women, unlikely characters and over the top violence; and it's all filmed in stylish black and white. The film is a lot like the slightly earlier masterpiece 'Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!' in style and execution, although Motor Psycho doesn't feel as extravagant as that film. The running time is only just over seventy minutes, so the film also feels a little underdeveloped. The plot is rather simple and focuses on a gang of motorcyclists who see fit to rape and torture various women. However, they bite off more than they can chew when they rape a veterinarian's wife, and he decides to pursue them, along with a woman whose husband was also killed by the gang. Naturally, this film is extremely entertaining, although it doesn't have a great deal of credibility. There are some really good scenes in the film, but unfortunately; there are also some 'not so good' ones, which bring the whole piece down. Still, this is a more than decent way to spend your time, and if you like Russ Meyer; I'm sure you won't have a problem with this."
218,tt0059474,/review/rw0090182/?ref_=tt_urv,"In some ways 'Motor Psycho' is almost like Russ Meyer's dummy run for his trash classic 'Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!', featuring three men on a rampage instead of three women, but this is a much darker and more serious movie than we generally expect from him. There is the wonderful Haji and a few buxom women on screen, but no outrageous sexual humour or camp touches. 'Motor Psycho' plays it fairly straight. The budget is non-existent, but the acting is pretty good, and despite Brahmin and pals not strictly being bikers you can see 'The Wild Angels' on the horizon, and maybe even 'The Last House On The Left'. Stephen Oliver plays disturbed Vietnam vet Brahmin who terrorizes several women in a desert community. Alex Rocco ('The Godfather', 'The Stunt Man') plays the local vet Cory Maddox, and after his wife Gail (Holle K. Winters) is raped and beaten by Brahmin and his sidekicks he vows revenge. While tracking the thugs down he meets Ruby Bonner (Haji) whose husband was recently murdered by them and they help each other when they get stranded in the desert. 'Motor Psycho' is a very gritty movie for the time, and surprisingly effective. A very good b-grade movie that deserves some more attention. Check it out."

MOTORPSYCHO was made first and it's basically the male version of FASTER PUSSYCAT: three bad guys roaming the desert and looking for kicks. There are several plot points that are even identical between the two movies. But today, MOTORPSYCHO has been totally eclipsed by FASTER PUSSYCAT or BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS. It's ironic because  MOTORPSYCHO was a bigger hit than FASTER PUSSYCAT, the latter having flopped on its initial release. FASTER PUSSYCAT is now a bona fine cult hit while MOTORPSYCHO toils in near obscurity. And it's unfortunate because it's one of the grittiest Film Noir I've ever seen. It's a true pulp novel come to life. It's a combo of Orson Welles' A TOUCH OF EVIL and a countless Film Noir from the 1940s. But unlike TOUCH OF EVIL or the older Film Noir films, MOTORPSYCHO doesn't shy away from the violence or the ""thrilling"" aspects of the story."

The most famous film to use the idea of psychotic children is probably the 1960 classic Village of the Damned; but it has been done many times since. Devil Times Five is perhaps something of an oddity within the genre as it doesn't particularly focus on the idea of the children being psychos, but instead puts its focus on the sleazy adult characters and gory death scenes. The plot focuses on a group of people staying at a snowbound lodge. Meanwhile, a bus carrying a group of psychotic children slips off the road; allowing the kids to escape. After taking out their guardian, the kids descend on the lodge where they are taken in by the people staying there. Shortly thereafter, the adults start turning up dead..."
221,tt0071413,/review/rw1417824/?ref_=tt_urv,"Over the years, many writers as well as filmmakers discovered that seemly innocent and cherubic looking children make extra-creepy horror villains! Demonic kids almost form an entire sub genre of horror by themselves! There usually is an explanation for their abnormal and murderous behavior, though. Either it's the influence of a satanic cult (""Children of the Corn""), a nuclear meltdown (""The Children of Ravensbeck""), a temporary blackout caused by a comet (""Village of the Damned"") or even an ordinary solar eclipse on the day of their birth (""Bloody Birthday""). The youthful maniacs in this film have no real excuse for what they do. They were just born evil. And when their bus to the mental institute crashes down atop some snowy mountains, they become youthful maniacs AT LARGE! They make it to a holiday resort where some wannabe godfather Corleone runs his crime syndicate and they start killing all the residents. ""Devil Times Five"" is not a very good movie, but that's mainly due to a lack of budget and a shortage of talented cast & crew members. There's very little going on in the first hour, apart from a spectacular bus crash and THE longest murder of an institute employee (filmed in slow-motion). When approaching the last third of the film, the creepy moments and gory murders begin to follow each other at fast pace and the atmosphere really gets morbid. The adults are all pitiful and uninteresting characters but the five kids have quite interesting backgrounds. The oldest girl pretends to be a young convent sister, another girl is obsessed with fire and the funny black kid constantly acts like he's in the army. Their incontrollable urge to slaughter unknown people is a bit difficult to believe at times, but overall these young actors do a terrific job. ""Devil Times Five"" is recommended 70's exploitation, with a fairly high cult-value and several unforgettable murder scenes (piranhas in the bathtub!!)"

Pretty soon the killer kids go on a rampage: they junk the guests' cars, cut the power lines, and begin to violently off Papa Doc's arrogant, decadent, back-stabbing clientèle (a lady gets set ablaze after being drenched with gasoline, another hapless lass has piranha dumped in her bathtub, that sort of ghastly stuff)."

Not much to stare at and a lot repetitive action. Outside the silly combination between the leads David Chokachi and Matthew Kevin Anderson, not much fun occurs. Still I got to hand it credit because the acting (the likes of Yancy Butler) was acceptable and it never took itself seriously, but everything else less so. The underwhelming CGI quality was expected; lazy and terrible with hokey monster designs and poorly staged action. The clichéd plot was inconsistent and uninspired with many stupid and bland inclusions. It was very much a stop and go affair despite its tendency to rush through things with poor explanations.

This movie knows it is a SyFy original and just has fun with it. The monster was interesting rather than just being another snake or crocodile, and the characters were entertaining rather than overly dramatic.

Yes, the story about a fetus growing on a woman's back and then becoming a four foot Indian ripping his way out of a tumor the size of basketball stretches the line of credibility. This pint-sized spirit has amazing powers as he can literally freeze an entire hospital ward, call forth the devil himself, and take the skin off of people's bodies through his mind.  The most ridiculous aspects of the film, however, are the explanation and execution of how to fight the manitou. Apparently all things in life have their own manitou, so we see this incredibly powerful spirit temporarily beaten when Tony Curtis throws a typewriter at him.  We are to believe the spirit of the machine harmed this powerful spirit.  Yeah, okay.  The special effects are very outdated and some of those will just make you burst out laughing.  The scene where Tony Curtis(the former boyfriend of the girl with the shoulder-weilding fetus/pint-sized Indian spirit) and Michael Ansara(playing John Singing Rock or something like that who just happens to be an Indian medicine man ready, able, and willing to do battle with the most powerful Indian medicine man's spirit that ever lived...and this one apparently has ripped through the shoulders or bellies of five previous people) walk into the hospital room and see what I guess is suppose to be space will have you slapping your knee.  But the very worst scene has to be the finale which I will not explain in great detail.  Suffice it to say that Susan Strasberg(the poor woman aforementioned) is sitting up on a bed topless..., yes, you heard me, TOPLESS, throwing ele trical current from her fingers as she battles the manitou.  It has to be seen to be believed.  The acting in the film is not very good, but again very likable.  Curtis plays a mystic and some of his scenes are good in the beginning.  Ansara is ok, and Burgess Meredith gives the best performance in his five minute cameo.

I could dog Mosquito pretty hard, but for the straight-to-video huge animal/insect sub-genre, it's probably the best (with Ticks coming in as a close second). It's just so funny.  I can't tell if the laughs are intentional or not. There are some things that are so absolutely hilarious that you have to believe they wrote it that way to get a laugh, but you're never quite sure. Here's the best dialogue shared between our characters: ""If I wasn't having such a sh*tty day, I'd kill you right now.""  ""Men a lot better than you have said that to me before, many times.""  Who has said that to you???  I really want to know.  Another favorite line is when Gunnar picks up the chainsaw. ""I haven't handled one of these babies in twenty years.""

I can understand that about Deathsport, but I think Battletruck (aka Warlords of the 21st Century) is downright good. I think the problem is that it's very similar to George Miller's The Road Warrior. Some IMDb reviewers even refer to it as a rip-off, but it was being made before The Road Warrior was ever even released, and, at least in most places, it was released almost at the exact same time (in the U.S. both were released in April of 1982). Compared to The Road Warrior, okay, Battletruck isn't nearly as good. But I won't hold that against it. The Road Warrior is all kinds of awesome. Battletruck is merely good, with a less ambitious story, though still probably too ambitious to completely succeed with the small budget it had. But still, it's pretty good. Michael Beck of The Warriors stars (though he doesn't appear for a good while into the film, which is a cool touch) as a lone wolf in this post-apocalyptic wasteland. He rescues Annie McEnroe (a character actress whom you might recognize from Beetlejuice and many other films), who has escaped her villain father (James Wainwright), but is left stranded in the middle of nowhere. Wainwright drives around in the titular truck raiding whatever settlements he can find and stealing all the oil and gasoline he can find. Beck takes McEnroe to a democratic settlement called Clearwater (among whose citizens is John Ratzenberger, who probably has more lines in this movie than any other before he started working with Pixar). They aren't all too trusting of Beck, who does some business with Clearwater but lives out on his own somewhere, and some of the citizens fear McEnroe's presence. That proves insightful when Wainwright comes along looking for her (and fuel). The action sequences in the film are well done, and the scenery is nice (it was filmed in New Zealand). Too bad it was shot in Academy ratio (or perhaps only still exists in that format)."

An earlier scene in the street in which I was accosted by a young boy, excitedly telling me that he'd just found a magic stone, was eliminated. Indeed, not only was this scene (and another in which I figured as worshiper in a weirdly colorful religious ceremony at a Red City temple), completely deleted, but the whole sub-plot involving this young lad was removed. He's no longer in ""Salute of the Jugger"" at all. That's a shame, because he was easily the best actor in the movie.

310,tt0092548,/review/rw1211430/?ref_=tt_urv,"American Ninja 2: The Confrontation is the best movie in the whole series and one of the best action movies I have ever seen. It has everything and what's more important: it has NINJAS! Tons of ninjas. In fact, there are so many ninjas in this movie that people got used to them. Ninjas wander around freely, shopping in supermarkets, hiding on roofs, driving cars, taking the sun on secluded beaches. This movie taught me one important lesson: ninjas are one of us and we should respect them. After seeing this great movie I say hello to ninjas on the street and I'm not afraid anymore to look under my bed in case a ninja is hiding there. We shouldn't be afraid of ninjas, ninjas are our friends! But back to the movie. It has three elements that make it so great: it has Michael Dudikoff, an exotic location, and a truck load of ninjas. The plot is simple, Dudikoff (himself being an invincible ninja) kicks some ninja ass then kicks some more and finally destroys the villain's master plan (sell clone-ninjas to other villains). But what makes this movie great is the unbelievable amount of action: ninja fights on a beach, bar fights, car chases, explosions, more explosions, sword fights. And if you think that ninjas perform only two basic functions: spying and killing, you're wrong. Because ninjas in American ninja 2 evolved, now they are also: bodyguards, sentinels, inept killers, car drivers, butlers, guards, human statues, decorations, extras, stunts, martial artists, masters of disguise and masters in ridiculing themselves. But why would a villain hire them instead of a conventional army? Because ninjas look cool and have three main characteristics that common soldiers don't have: they are FAST (the quickness with which their ass gets kicked is just amazing), they are SILENT (maybe they're silent, but that doesn't help them when they wander around in their black suits in broad daylight!) and they are DEADLY (I don't think they managed to kill anyone in the movie let alone even scratching Dudikoff). And the potential buyers are all a brilliant assortment of stereotyped villains: from the street pimp and the drug lord to the south-American dictator and the Arabian prince. And the main base of the villain is even more stereotyped, it has everything a villain dreams of: a representative logo (a lion with a shuriken in his head), a lab (with scientists and all), an arena (where ninjas can perform) and an office (from where the villain can dominate the world). And the most amazing thing is that if you are dressed like a ninja you can easily enter this heavily guarded complex and wander around freely. Ninjas walk the halls, buy coffees, take the elevators, go on cigarette breaks. They are just like us, but dressed like ninjas! Black ones, blue ones, red ones, it doesn't matter. The more the merrier. I learned the lesson and I'm sure you'll all learn it too after seeing this movie: ninjas are one of us. And remember, ninjas are EVERYWHERE!"

This time taking on ""superninjas"" they weren't so super to me there. Both Armstrong and Jackson(Michael Dudikoff and Steve James) were always on top of things. The Marines weren't so warm to the Army Rangers at first, but when it was getting the job done Armstrong and Jackson don't play around. Armstrong was all techniques, Jackson was all power, that's why he is later named ""Powerhouse"" Jackson. He was the martial artist with attitude. Especially when he stomped on the ninja and he said, ""STAY DOWN!"" You don't play with Powerhouse Jackson. The outside fight scene with Joe and the ninjas were memorable as well. I liked the part where Joe catches the dart with his hand and took out that ninja with the shuriken(throwing star). These characters were outrageous, they'll make any brawler run home to mama.

Like the first movie, James steals the show from Dudikoff, both in his martial arts skills and with a bouncy performance that makes him a treat to watch. The best that can be said about Dudikoff's performance is that he seems to be a lot more comfortable in front of the camera than he was the first time around. He's still very unemotional, has almost no dialogue, and it's still clear he knows little to nothing about martial arts, seeing how he does pretty simple moves (when not being doubled.)"

Even Tim Burton's terrific 'Ed Wood' has encouraged this. My opinion is that there are many, many worse directors out there, because at least Wood's movies were fun and entertaining, unlike many of those made by the likes of  Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay, directors who are able to work with budgets a 1000 times bigger than Wood I might add! 'Bride Of The Monster' is one of Wood's most underrated movies. It was his second movie to star horror legend Bela Lugosi, but unlike the first, the truly mind blowing 'Glen Or Glenda', it isn't completely inept. True, some of the acting is terrible, especially the talentless leading lady Loretta King who is (I admit it) lousy, and Wood regular Paul Marco, who has a small supporting role as a cop. But, and this is a BIG but, Lugosi is terrific. Many fans regard this as his best performance. I wouldn't go that far but it's hard not to get choked up at Lugosi's immortal ""I have no home"" speech. 'Bride Of The Monster' is the first Wood film to feature the amazing Tor Johnson. He plays Lugosi's Tibetan servant/slave Lobo. All the scenes with Lobo are great fun to watch, especially when Lugosi whips him. Apart from Lugosi and Tor this movie is best remembered for the rubber octopus monster. Of course it's a hoot, but the rest of the picture isn't anywhere near as bad as many claim and is comparable to say 'The Devil Bat', which Lugosi starred in back in the 1940s. Both movies suffer from their minuscule budgets, but both are still worth watching to see Lugosi struggle for greatness. I recommend 'Bride Of The Monster' to all horror fans, especially those of Bela Lugosi."

Bela whipping Johnson and then getting into a wrestling match is definitely a high point.  The rest of the cast strive to be mediocre...and fail...with the exception of character actor Harvey Dunn.  Dunn plays the police chief and is humorous both intentionally and unintentionally.  Watch his scenes and see him play with his parakeet in his office.

""Reefer Madness"" falls into the same category, even though the production of it was somewhat better, with an added bonus for the folks involved with the making of it ...It was also meant to be used as a ""teaching"" tool. Teaching in this instance being synonymous with propaganda. Calling this flick ""highly exaggerated"" or ""over the top"" is putting it mildly.

He has a blank expression in his eyes a lot of the time, and other times he seems plain nervous, as if he doesn't seem to know what to do. And it's clear that he was far from an expert in martial arts, seeing that the choreography has him doing pretty simple moves much of the time, and that for the most part he does only one or two moves before the editing cuts to another angle."

The star of the film is ex-porn star Jacqueline Lovell better known as Sara St James who plays a cheating wife looking to have her husband killed.  Lovell gives a performance worthy of better source material and she gives the you the impression that a name change and a career move could prove very worthwhile for her.  The film works because it doesn't take itself seriusly, the plot is crazy, the characters are shallow, the effects will make you laugh and the girls are sexy while losing their clothes at every chance they get.

The genre has become so artificially popularized and 'fetishized' that most recent low budget films have seemed more like relatively capable ventures trying to 'appear' as b-movies. I always felt the overall cinematic incompetence of b-movies was a result of poor financial and technological resources available to the filmmaker. Today the idea of a consciously manipulated shaky digicam is considered to be 'low-tech'. How pretentious! Sorry, I just don't have the ability to reconcile the inherent academic quagmire of the high-tech/low-tech dichotomous relationship that is today's modern b-cinema.

382,tt0099817,/review/rw1000965/?ref_=tt_urv,"As an action lover firstly, Dark Angel is a film that any enthusiast will find hard not to enjoy. It's a great, and entertaining slice of violent sci-fi hokum served up in a brisk 89 minutes. Secondly as a fans of Dolph Lundgren, it marks perhaps his most polished and entertaining solo work. The 80's itself was a great time for action movies, with countless action stars, and the essential ingredients were a simple plot, plenty of wise cracking and plenty of action. Lundgren had been responsible for the far more stern and serious action flicks Red Scorpion and the under-rated Punisher film yet Dark Angel was one of a string of 3 films Dolph did, very much in the trend of Schwarzenegger's simpler action films like Red Heat, Running Man and Raw Deal. It was brainless, yet highly enjoyable, slick and violent. Dolph followed this entertaining fare with the similarly comic book styled Showdown In Little Tokyo and then Universal Soldier. These three films remain Dolph's apex. He got the humour right in them and they are best described as Arnie styled actioners. Dark Angel though had a twist on the concept with the slightly imaginative idea of an Alien coming down from outer space, injecting victims full of heroin and then using hi-tech alien techniques, removing the endorphins from the brain. It's implausible but who cares? Naturally Dolph has to save the day and has help from uptight FBI pen pusher Brian Benben. What marks this film as Dolphs career highlight is the fact that this is his movie, 100%. Dolph is the star, the head honcho. His other best films had him share the screen with bigger, or soon to be bigger stars like Stallone, Van Damme and Brandon Lee. The chemistry between Lundgren and Benben works superbly, and Lundgren is on fine Arnie zinger form. It makes you wonder why some of the one liners in his other films don't come off when he delivered them so perfectly in this film. In some respects this is a Dolph out of Dolph movie, with him sporting dark brown hair and brown contacts."

With a running time of about 90 minutes, it doesn't overstay its welcome, and its fast pace and surprises prevent you from being bored at any point in it. There are a ton of clichés, but the story is pretty original. Brian Benben(whom, I won't lie to you, was the thing I most looked forward to seeing in this, and I wasn't disappointed) is the procedural jerk, and Dolph is the cop who plays by his own rules. The action is excellent and thoroughly enjoyable, with shoot-outs, car-chases and some physical fighting. The editing is fairly good for this sort of thing, and the camera-work is never downright poor. This is non-committal, guilty pleasure fun throughout the entire thing, and that is reflected in the dialog, the characters, the acting, etc. There is a bit of quirk here and there in the writing. I will not give away too much of the plot; all I'll say is that there is, indeed, an alien(with bad-ass weaponry) in this, and the flick is a blast to watch. There is plenty of strong language and a little nudity, and both are gratuitous. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys kicking back with something simple that clearly had effort put into making it something that delivers what it promises. 6/10"

It's entirely spent establishing an implausible relationship between a Nathalie (Whitney Moore), a hot fashion model and a Rod (Alan Bagh), computer geek. I know this sort of thing is a staple in horror and sci fi movies, but usually the nerd has some hidden charms. Rod is basically just annoying and full of himself. Also, the relationship normally develops in the context of the plot and involves at least *some* dramatic tension. In this case, they meet and she is immediately swept off her feet by his complete lack of charm and affected speech patterns.

The actors in all of the major roles are pretty good, and director Arthur Hiller - a man known more for mainstream comedies and dramas such as ""Love Story"" - does his best working within a different genre. It's true that the film doesn't have very much suspense, but the animal attacks are NOT that badly done, despite the presence of some chintzy effects.

In order to avoid further immigration, the misanthropic Kufard (small but terrific role for veteran Paul Naschy) arrests everybody who washes ashore Puerto Angel. One day, he also arrests the young American couple Dante and Ula. They were playing the rich-kids game of ""infiltration"", in which the players illegally have to cross country borders. That game is just asking for trouble, if you ask me... Some time later, Dante escapes from a prison-transport and heads back to Puerto Angel in order to save Ula, only he's chased by a partly robotic and bloodthirsty Rottweiler that rips every living thing to pieces. The movie is truly incoherent, with extended and unnecessary flashbacks, and often provokes unintentional chuckles. It's fast-paced, though, and contains loads of sleaze and bloody deaths. The Terminatoresque dog looks thrilling and the music as wells as the opening credits are very funky. The acting is atrocious, but that what happens if you recruits cheap Spanish actors and force them to play American characters. The lead guy looks a lot like Orlando Bloom but his acting skills are even worse. ""Rottweiler"" surely is a meaningless horror film, but it remains fun to watch."

One in particular is when several of the kids look for their parents at a concentration camp. Harry Dean Stanton gives a powerful performance that serves to show that he's a genuine actor.

Mainly because ""Blood Beach"" is rather slow and boring. ""Jaws"", at times, also wasn't all that about action & horror, more about the characters really, but it had a fine plot structure, good dialogues and decent acting to keep things going. But I shall not just dismiss ""Blood Beach"" as a bad B-monster movie (though it certainly isn't a good one). The main attraction amongst the cast is John Saxon, who is the best actor of the lot, injects a nice amount of sarcasm in his role and simply has the best lines of the movie. Then there's Burt Young, who's just great as Sergeant Royko, bragging about Chicago all the time, eating various sort of junk-food in almost every scene and referring to someone's brain as ""vegetable soup"". The music was pretty memorable too, with a dark cello theme and some jazzy saxophones. And the beach-monster was just too weird. It looked like a giant, dusty, plastic flower. But unfortunately it's only shown in a few shots when it emerges from the sand near the end. The shots over the end credits leave room for a sequel (""Blood Beach 2: The Offspring"", would have been a very appropriate title, I believe), but that never happened. ""Blood Beach"" could have been a cult classic, but unfortunately the movie feels just a bit too mainstream (and too uneventful also) for it to be one."

If you like these sort of movies and get the chance watch this in Japanese and see it for the first time.

""Godzilla Raids Again"", or ""Godzilla's Counterattack"" as its original title literally translates, is a flawed film. But like the first Godzilla, it's an allegorical classic.

Thankfully, Classic Media one more comes through, even including the Japanese version. This film was decent at best, no where near as powerful as the first. The four fathers of Godzilla weren't all here, Honda and Ifukbe, probably a major factor in the sharp contrast.

453,tt0048127,/review/rw1873847/?ref_=tt_urv,"I finally now have seen this the second Godzilla movie made. The first where Godzilla takes on another monster...the other monster presented is Anguirus. The story was pretty good for the most part as they make it clear in the Japanese cut anyway, that this is a new Godzilla and not the one destroyed by the oxygen destroyer. Also, this new monster is also discovered. The cities just off the coast are on alert, everything seems to go well until a bunch of prisoners escape and start a large fire (light apparently attracts Godzilla)and not only does he come, but so does Anguirus and they battle in the city. After the battle there is time to relax as Godzilla leaves peaceful like enough and the city was evacuated very well this time too. Everything is going well until Godzilla reappears in a more northern town, however at one point he is in the middle of a bunch of snow capped mountains and a plan is hatched to stop Godzilla's onslaught again. This movie could have been better though, there is a lot of filler in this movie, I am thinking they felt they needed more scenes to pad out a rather short running time film. However, with this movie coming out only six months after the original, the extra scenes had to be scenes of people rather than of the monsters. Also, the film goes on a bit to long well after the battle between the two monsters. So much so that the threat of Godzilla seems to even evaporate for a time. I also think the plane scene at the end went on to long as their plan should have to worked after they figured it out rather than going back to base to load up on missiles. However, the fight between the two monsters is rather good, and unlike the professional wrestling like quality of the next movie ""Godzilla vs King Kong"" in this one the monsters fighting seems to be like that of two actual animals and not men in costumes. I think this one would have been much better though if they did not rush to complete it."

For example, THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS (1953) clearly led to Japanese films such as Godzilla (1954) and its many spin-offs. In general, these films were super-cheesy--having pretty second-rate special effects (even for the time) and lousy dialog. Godzilla was a guy in a reptile suit, TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE used a lobster and THE KILLER SHREWS used hairy costumes placed on dogs--all very high on the ""cheese-o-meter"".

My only regret is that this is all too infrequent and most of it arriving at the end of the film.  The rest of the story centers around Kenneth Tobey, Faith Domerge and Donald Curtis trying to discover what it is that held Tobey's submarine.

Even people who don't know Ro-Man's name recognize his likeness and giggle. 'Robot Monster' isn't as inept technically as Wood's worst movies (especially his astonishing 'Glen Or Glenda'), but the script is as dumb as they get, the actors are wooden at best, and the not-so-special effects are laughable. What really makes this movie legendary is the ""robot monster"" himself, Ro-Man (George Barrows). You can help smirking every time you look at him, and when he pontificates on life and love the movie enters a new dimension of trash par excellence.

The plot is so thin that it can't even be stretched comfortably over the film's 66-minute running time without generous padding.

When the guy in the monkey suit is far and away the best actor in the picture, you've got a MAJOR problem--but compared to John Mylong as ""The Professor,"" Ro-Man is Laurence Olivier.

Bad news as this houses some big ass monster that likes to tear people apart. Oh, and a shower. This low-rent sci-fi horror is like ALIEN and ALIENS but on a budget of a few thousand. In the positive department, DeCoteau knows how to properly get exploitation material (nudity, gore, slime, mutant rats) up on the screen. The downside is there isn't really much else. The end has the hero (Richard Hawkins) confronting the monster alone and I swear he lets the thing sneak up on him about 50 times. To make matters worse, Creepozoid dies but immediately produces some mutant baby Creepozoid, Jr. that proceeds to sneak up on our hero 25 times before he strangles it with its umbilical cord."

I have utmost respect for director Castellari for movies such as the great late Spaghetti Western ""Keoma"" with Franco Nero in the lead, but it ""Bronx Warriors"" is certainly not one of the highlights of his career. Although ""The Bronx Warriors"" is overall a silly film that lacks in many departments, it has some qualities and is fun to watch if you're a fan of apocalyptic 80s trash.

Before I watched it I thought it was going to be a deliriously silly and hugely entertaining trash classic, but I'm afraid for me it just never quite made it. Not that it completely sucks mind you, but I was a bit disappointed. I think if you watched this playing a drinking game where you imbibe every time you see or hear ""The Bronx"" it might make it a lot more fun! (I said ""see"" because I was fortunate enough to see this in the original Italian with English subtitles) The two leads are pretty dull, muscleman Trash (Mark Gregory) and runaway rich girl Ann (Stefania Girolami), but the supporting cast includes Vic Morrow (his second last movie), George Eastman (from Joe D'Amato's notorious 'Antropophagus' aka 'The Grim Reaper'), and best of all, blaxploitation legend Fred Williamson ('Black Caesar', 'That Man Bolt', 'From Dusk Til Dawn',etc.etc.). Though why Morrow's character is called Hammer instead of Williamson's is quite puzzling! Anyway, this is quite enjoyable low budget idiocy with some rather laughable looking gangs and enough fight scenes and explosions to satisfy most people. I can't say I was knocked out by it, but it's worth watching, especially if you are a fan of Fred Williamson who steals the movie. But make sure you watch the John Carpenter and Walter Hill classics that ""inspired"" this first. They are both GENUINE trash classics, not a limp imitation like '1990': The Bronx Warriors'."

But he doesn't finish the job when a bit of his human heart takes over. Paco heads to the Nevada desert to hide out and, while at a cheapo motel, becomes the region's champion arm wrestler. Because we all know arm wrestling is the sport of the future. I laughed out loud when they showed their wall of arm wrestling champs that included wrestlers Bruno Sammartino, Hillbilly Jim, Magnum TA and Dory Funk, Jr. Lead Greene looked so familiar but I couldn't place him. Checking here at the IMDb, he played the Dad in KINGPIN and the meathead in ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK. So there is life after Sergio Martino movies. Janet Agren, John Saxon, George Eastman and Donald O'Brien show up for support and are all fine. Sadly, I also read here that Italian character actor Claudio Cassinelli, who plays Saxon's hired hit-man, was killed in a helicopter crash while filming that.

Or in case you're a guest at a feminist gathering, I wouldn't advise mentioning ""Fists of Steel"" neither, as the film is literally stuffed with macho characters and typically male showdowns. In fact, to put it rather bluntly, ""Fists of Steel"" is a movie for guys, and preferably guys that like their heroes invincible, their women docile, their action & violence graphic & plentiful and their dialogs and story lines rudimentary.

Because he had a change of heart and left the old man alive, and now Paco is the target of both the authorities and the organization who hired him. He leaves town, braving the acid rain (because it's the future and the environment, while appearing absolutely normal at a glance, has fallen on hard times) to hide out in the Arizona desert.

One of the reasons why Hammer horror is so brilliant is that it isn't afraid to make a film that most other film studios would regard as stupid and then make it work. The main reason why Hammer horror does work is that the films, despite showing many macabre images, are always good natured and made with a lot of heart so they're easy to like; and this one is no different.

One of the biggest names to emerge in the decade was Clive Barker, whose pull-no-punches approach and love of the stomach-churning side of sexuality provided a racier alternative to the milder King and Koontz.

 First, Sheriff Chuck has a girlfriend, Toni Kalem, and they spend as 
 much time as possible in bed giving us a great view of her ample chest. 
 Now, that is not typical Norris behavior! When Norris visits a biker 
 bar, we get to see some of his typical style as he cleans the place 
 out. You knew that was going to happen, but, before he does, his 
 Deputy, Stephen ""Flounder"" Furst (Animal House) gets an eyeful from one 
 of the biker chicks, Lillette Zoe Raley, in her only movie. What a 
 shame! We also see some action from the other biker mommas (Linda Tatum 
 and Kathleen Lee) before Norris arrives. I've never seen so much action 
 in a Norris film.
 
 All of this is just titillation as the real story is the mad scientist 
 and his partner (Steven Keats and William Finley) develop a serum that 
 resuscitates a dead man and causes his wounds to heal immediately, 
 Bullets, falls from second stories, cars, fire - nothing stops this 
 guy. Well, you know who will eventually stop him, or does he? This is 
 the only film in which I have seen Ron Silver in a humane role. He was

The director would have told him to play the part of a man that has become almost zombie-like, and who has the ability to recover quickly and suddenly, and then left the rest up to the imagination of Brian. Well Brian certainly rose to the occasion, and his work in that last portion of the movie alone should have earned him an award. So yeah, the movie overall might be B-grade stuff, but Brian Libby deserves credit and recognition where it is due, and it is worth while seeing the film just for what he brings to the screen in that last half.

He's grown up with an obsession with Christmas; the decorations at his place have a Christmas theme, for one thing. He's dismayed at the attitudes displayed by co-workers at his place of employment, a toy factory, and goes so far as to catalogue the naughty or nice activities of children in his neighbourhood. When he learns that his company plans on donating toys to a local hospital, but expects all employees to make any financial donations, that's when he truly becomes determined to spread his own brand of Christmas cheer."

House on Haunted Hill was much loved then - and now - for it's ludicrous plot line and hammy performances, and The Tingler marks another successful fusion of these elements. The plot line is even sillier this time round, and it follows Vincent Price's scientist as he conducts his experiments into fear. He discovers that when we get frightened, a thing, which he called 'the tingler', manifests itself on the spinal column and the only way to rid oneself of this 'tingler' is to scream. Deaf mute's cant scream, however, and soon after discovering that his friend's wife suffers from that condition, and has an acute fear of blood, Price gets to work on attempting to isolate and remove the tingler."

Moreover, the cast attack the blithely base and tasteless material with unfettered aplomb: Diminutive porn stud Luis De Jesus has a fiendish field day as Sardu's savage dwarf assistant Ralphus, Dan Fauci contributes an amusing turn as meddlesome blackmailing Sergeant John Tucci, Alan Dellay makes for a perfectly obnoxious jerk as uptight snob critic Creasy Silo, and lovely blonde Viju Krem is suitably sweet and fragile as fetching abducted ballerina Natasha D'Natalie. The authentically grubby New York City locations, Ron Dorfman's basic cinematography, a hilariously cruel sense of spot-on pitch-black gallows humor (this fine fetid flick is essentially a remarkably dark satire on the seamy underbelly of show business), and Michael Small's alternately jaunty and shivery synthesizer score further enhance this gloriously ghastly atrocity's considerable uniquely gross and repugnant charm.

They have to go through many obstacles on their way to finding a way past the deadly creatures that feast upon human flesh. From the rooftop where we left them, to the sheriff's office, and to a drainage pipe. You will get to see one person tired of the abuse get out of the film fairly quickly, lots of deaths, the use of gunpowder to stop the bleeding, and an ending that made me go ""what""? It is far from perfect as the tunnel scenes were a bit dark and they used night vision camera's a bit to much. Still the cast is still funny in a strange way and I like the way it follows the first movies format of introducing the characters and the previous movies combined. It is nice in this entire series that the monsters are a combination of costume and makeup rather than the computer generated monsters of the science fiction channel too. I don't understand why the score is so low here on the same level with the abysmal ""Automaton Transfusion"" as that piece of crap had no sort of ending whatsoever and the effects were not good even for a low budget movie.

559,tt0094597,/review/rw0253508/?ref_=tt_urv,"Much better than you may have heard, though it requires a great deal of patience. The first half is pretty slow, but not completely without merit because it showcases the comedic talents of the gifted Sandy Dennis who is a riot as the taunted teen's overprotective, religious fanatic mother. Dennis takes the Piper Laurie role in CARRIE even further, but this time plays the role for laughs, and she's absolutely magnificent every minute she's on the screen. She comes across in this film as an even more out-of-control Shelley Winters(another great actress). The second half however is what viewers will most likely remember about the film because it features some very wacky and crudely effective special effects. The FX are pretty good too for such a low-budget effort and all. Besides Dennis, the top acting honors go to Stephen Geoffreys who is just about perfect as the terrorized teen who turns the tables on his tormentors. Generally speaking, audiences and critics alike have been much too harsh on this nifty little flick. Actor Robert Englund, who had played nightmare-invading/teen throat-slashing Freddy Krueger in the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET movies for several years, was a perfect choice to direct this scary/funny movie. I don't care what anyone says, good job Robert!!!!! Yes, CARRIE is a masterpiece of horror, but if you wan't to see a more humerous take on the same theme, then 976-EVIL is the way to go."
560,tt0094597,/review/rw3630791/?ref_=tt_urv,"I guess I have a soft spot, a very small one, for this forgotten film, which was directed by horror icon Robert Englund. I think it's because it came out at the end of the 80's, which is the decade I saw the majority of my horror films, as I consider myself a horror buff. I've seen it listed as either 1988 or 1989, but I don't think I've seen many more horror films since then, as the 80's wrapped up my teen years. An interesting tidbit has star Stephen Geoffreys basically become a gay porn star not long after this film came out, no pun intended. You probably won't recognize anyone else, other than perhaps Sandy Dennis, and maybe Robert Picardo. I thought the premise of the film was fairly original; you call a ""horrorscope"" number, and you get to speak to the Devil. There's a catch though, if you don't do what ""he"" says, you get a strange sounding ring on a nearby pay phone(remember them?)and bad stuff may happen to you. Buyer beware! I'll get the bad out of the way; first off, I didn't like how Hoax decided to play a cruel, but deadly joke on Suzie, considering she was very nice to him, and even tried to protect him from bullies. Her death scene was pretty lame, as far as horror standards go. Also, the way the house turned into a foamy ice inside, and the fire effects under the house, were cheesy at best. I did like the creature's make-up for the most part, although the extra large hands and feet could've been done better. I also thought the fish falling from the sky was interesting, and I haven't seen anything like it before or after this film. Mark Dark was a very cool addition, but I wish there was more background on his character. To finish this review, I'll reiterate that this has some late 80's charm to me, and was probably one of the last horror films I saw, at least from what I can recall, as the 80's gave me some really cool horror film memories, and I'll proudly include this film as well."

The main reason a horror film doesn't work is because the characters don't hook you.  I started to care about the characters after just a few scenes.  The mother who is in love with religion is hilarious--we all know people like her. The son, Hoax, is heartbreaking because he is so weak that he will grasp at anything to be strong.  I think we all know him too.  Robert Englund was very careful to build up the suspense. There are lots of times when you know that someone is going to die, and he draws it out to the point where it is almost painful to watch (I obviously can't give examples without ruining it.) So, I recommend it to anyone who likes horror."

This is due to the fact that instead of bombarding us with cheap gore effects (aside from a couple of clumsy ones), the film works at and actually succeeds in creating a spooky atmosphere of dread and foreboding.

If you thought the characters in the first movie was awkward and weird, the characters in this film is on another level. This film just tries too hard to be over the top and way more crude and messed up, but that necessarily isn't a good thing. The monsters aren't even intimidating as they were in the first film, cause they seem slower and more vulnerable although they are larger in number this time around. Some of the characters seem similar as well, like the character Greg Swank which is like a sleazy and stupider version of the Coach in the first film, while giving some random speech about team work and working together while trying to play the hero, but just ends up messing everything up which I think was intentional but not as funny this time around, except when he gets the monsters to puke on grandma and pee on the girls which was a bit amusing to watch. This one tries to add some crude humor but it's just not that funny and ends up just being repulsive. There are also more random stuff going on in this film compared to the first one in order to add some humor, but doesn't really work. Like the scene where they try to catapult a midget to another building, it was pointless attempt at some crude humor which takes up a lot of time but really isn't even that funny, well at least it led to seeing the Tat Girl and Tit Girl's bare breasts so I guess is somewhat forgivable for a film like this. Everything in the sequel makes the audience get numb after a while and doesn't add the shock value they seem to be trying to achieve with it's vomit and gagging jokes thrown in. Also you didn't get the see much of the monsters in the first film which I think is a good thing, cause in this one it looks like men wearing rubber suits. Also the quality of this film appear way less than the first film, although the first one was low budget as well. The Bartender and Honey Pie was the only characters that appear again after the first ""Feast"" and Honey Pie don't add anything to the film but get beaten up, stumble around trying to survive but it all amounts to nothing, just about every character in this movie just isn't noteworthy. I give this film some props for at least trying to be more crazy than the first film, while being gimmicky. This isn't a terrible spoof though. The cinematography is nicely done for a ""B"" movie and at least they tried to be somewhat original while showing 2 hot girls bare breasts while kicking ass, the ending will make you feel cheated but I guess it's to set the audience up for part 3. The death of idiots and prick characters in this film is satisfying to watch as well, I think I might be giving this sequel a 6.3 out of nostalgia cause of the first."

The film professes that Satan sent his minions, the Gargoyles, down to Earth and they have been subdued by humankind. We follow the fortunes of Dr. Mercer Boley and his daughter Diana as they travel across the desert, and end up finding a colony of the aforementioned Gargoyles. The film doesn't take itself very seriously, and this turns out to be a good thing as director Bill L. Norton is not held back by trying to make the film credible, and instead is given licence to fully explore the subject material. It's hard not to laugh at certain points during the film, but the ideas on show are mostly good and that is all you can really expect from a film like this. The story is entertaining too and more than adequately fills the 75 minute running time, and the director also manages to create a creepy atmosphere and a fair few scares. Well worth seeing."

The laser head-explosion sequence is famous and there are multiple other cheese-highlights. But what is perhaps the most surprising, are the engaging acting performances and the welcome amount of tasteful nudity. The most familiar cute face in the cast is Barbara Crampton who stars as a screaming beauty in between her two greatest films ""Re-Animator"" and ""From Beyond"".

602,tt0086610,/review/rw1965595/?ref_=tt_urv,"Like director Harry Bromley Davenport mentions on the (very amusing and upfront short) interview that comes with the double pairing DVD of the first two films, it's a mess. Simple as that. It's an incoherent slab of twisted ideas and episodic plots, some quite random (a dwarf in a clown costume springs out of nowhere) in quite a bewildering British low-budget Sci-fi / horror production. No wonder why this is considered a cult favourite. Trashy and nasty junk indeed, but unusually compelling because you just don't know how it's going to go about things. Instead of a clear-cut narrative (as it does have a unique spin on the various materials within), the header is to mainly shock, baffle and weird out. It effectively does that with few creative visuals, bloody make-up FX and crass special effects. Achieved from the eerie imagery and Davenport's elastically wallowing synthesizer (sounding quite second-rate, but uncannily otherworldly) score is a thick dose of atmosphere. Even the film's colouring is drearily painted. Davenport's direction is eccentrically boundless and this helps it move quickly without outstaying its welcome, (even if has that slow-burn style to it). The cast are more than decent. Bernice Stegers provides a strong show-in and lifts it up with her presence. Philip Sayer is capably empathetic and the lovely French actress Maryam D'Abo makes her acting debut. A curiously surreal and sombre uneven (purposely I guess?) b-grade fright feature that from the get-go, leaves you pretty much in the dark."

I held my breath as I fed it into my video player. I expected it to be bad. Real bad. Ted V. Mikels bad. Even Donald G. Jackson bad. (and that my friends is quite possibly as bad as it gets!)

This is a superior sci fi video nasty. It's stupid yes, but it knows it is, and it delivers the goods. The plot itself is simple: man abducted by aliens returns years later to reunite with his son, but that in no way conveys just how freakin' STRANGE this movie is! Plus it contains nudity from Maryam D'Abo (the loveliest of the lovely D'Abo sisters), an unforgettably bizarre birth screen, a demented clown, and plenty of gore.

A man who was abducted by aliens returns home after a long absence and makes a faltering attempt at regaining his previous ordinary life with horrifically disastrous consequences for both himself and his family. Acting, direction and narrative coherence take a back seat to an alarming succession of increasingly daft, shocking and gloriously grotesque graphic set pieces: a luckless lady who's been brutally raped by a hideous extraterrestrial crab-like beast gives painful, life-taking birth to a fully grown man (nasty!) in a truly gag-inducing scene, a half-human, half-alien guy causes a pay phone to melt after he touches it, comely French au pair girl and future James Bond movie starlet Maryam (""The Living Daylights"") d'Abo gets wrapped up in a cocoon that's located directly above the bathroom shower so she can be used as an incubator for alien eggs (luckily the luscious Maryam gets to do two eye-popping and much-appreciated gratuitous nude scenes prior to meeting this ghastly fate), d'Abo's libidinous boyfriend winds up being mauled by a panther after being chased around the house by a dangerous animated toy tank (yes, you read that correctly), and, in perhaps the film's single most stupendously strange sequence, a GI Joe doll gets blown up to normal man size so it can come to life and take out a snoopy old lady neighbor (I'm honestly not making this crazy stuff up). Amid all this magnificently messed-up lunacy the movie's ""you can't go back home"" subtext somehow manages to acquire a certain cock-eyed poignancy that's in equal degrees oddly affecting and genuinely unnerving. Alas, this terrifically twisted and authentically outré treat was followed by a couple of dire, scarcely related by-the-numbers sequels which sadly lack the original's startlingly unpredictable free-form approach to telling a story."

So instead I'm just going to list reasons why this picture rules. 1) Charles Bronson as the ever-unflappable Paul Kersey is the very epitome of stoic, laconic and unflappable vigilante cool; this guy not only kills countless low-life criminal scum with a winning mix of style and ingenuity, but also sports one hell of a snazzy mustache to boot. 2) The street gang featured in this flick is a pretty mean and colorful bunch: Gavan O'Herlithy as vicious leader Fraker (you just have to love his gnarly reverse Mohawk haircut), a pre-""Bill and Ted"" Alex Winter as the sleazy Hermosa, Ricco Ross as speed-snorting psycho Cuban, and, best of all, the incredible Kirk Taylor as swift, maniacal, chortling klepto the Giggler. Moreover, the gang is multi-racial, which enables the filmmakers to treat us to the touching and inspiring sight of various whites, blacks and Hispanics gleefully engaging in rape, murder, robbery, extortion, destruction of private property, and other such no-count nasty antics. 3) The dialogue is sheer cut-to-the-bone terse and eloquent poetry. Martin Balsam as tough World War II veteran Bennett Cross bellows the following heart-shattering lines as he watches his beloved place of business go down in flames: ""My shop! My shop! That's my shop!"" 4) Deborah Raffin as feisty public defender Kathryn Davis supplies some mighty fetching eye candy. Alas, after Raffin becomes romantically involved with Bronson the poor gal gets bumped off by the bad guys. Boy, now isn't that a shocking and unexpected plot development? "

With an extremely modest budget, Bava put together a colorfully stylish and unsettling adventure in which two collaborating spaceships investigate mysterious signals coming from the planet Aura. Strange events occur when the ships approach the planet and some sort of very powerful and vile force awaited the astronauts. Visually, this certainly isn't Bava's most impressive work.... The effects are dodgy, the cardboard sets are goofy and the flashy light bulbs all over the spaceships are too kitschy! And yet our marvelous director manages to create a claustrophobic tension and an eerie Gothic surrounding. The ""aliens"" are in fact a breed of body snatchers and when the host bodies rise up from their tombs again (still wrapped in icky plastic) this gives an immensely creepy effect. Bava emphases this neatly with the use of fogs and ominous sounds The ending is brilliant as well and it fits perfectly in the apocalyptic/paranoia/takeover trend that ruled in sci-fi plotting around that time."

622,tt0073778,/review/rw1830928/?ref_=tt_urv,"""Switchblade Sisters"" is one of the most awesome and amusingly incompetent trash/gangsploitation movies ever made; only back in the period when it got released nobody ever intended to make a bad film, of course. Personally, I enjoyed the privilege of seeing this film in a genuine grindhouse theater and with no less than writer/director Jack Hill present there to introduce the film and answer questions from the audience. Hill explained how he always dreamed of filming his very own version of Shakespeare's ""Othello"", yet this story was probably the closest he ever came to realizing that project. Irrelevant info, I know, but this just to illustrate ""Switchblade Sisters"" once actually was a remotely ambitious film and not just a piece of lesbian trash. The recent revival of drive-in & grindhouse cinema (courtesy of Quentin Tarantino, who's also a giant fan of this particular film) enlarges the sleaze-elements and silliness of 70's movies even more, but you should always at least try and see it in its framework of time. That being said, ""Switchblade Sisters"" is first and foremost a delightfully absurd gang-wars movie and a thoroughly flamboyant portrait of female empowerment. This baby has it all! Stereotypical gang members that easily look over 30 but still attend high-school, big fat ugly lesbian prison wardens, romantic rivalry, jealousy, treason, roller-skating shootouts, secretly desired rape sequences and  last but not least  female Maoist guerrilla fighters. Maggie is the ravishing and potent new chick on the block and she eagerly joins Lace's Dagger Debs gang after proving herself in a knifing contest. The Debs are the girlfriends of the Silver Daggers and all together they hang out in a ramshackle hangar to play pool and sell dope. There's a gang war with the Crabs in the offing and jealous Dagger Deb Patch inflicts a dispute between best friends Maggie & Lace when she notices they both fancy the same hunk. If you can overlook (and you simply must when you're interested in this type of cinema) the sometimes atrocious performances, one-dimensional characters and the absolute lack of logic & coherence, you will find great enjoyment here! The clichéd situations inside the penitentiary (with the obese lesbian warden), out in the schoolyard (with the nervous principal) and in the skating hall (random M-16 gunfire!) are all sublime. The whole finale, from the actual virulent street war up until the main Jezebels' showdown contest, is simultaneously suspenseful, spirited and even a bit touching. The soundtrack is great, although clearly not as enchanting as the ones featuring in Jack Hill's ultimate Blaxploitation masterworks ""Coffy"" and ""Foxy Brown"". Speaking of which, this movie perhaps lacks the powerful and attention-demanding presence of a starlet like Pam Grier, but the girls here are still more than adequate. The supportive characters are actually more convincing than the main ones. Lace, played by Robbie Lee, is an often intolerable and whiny child and Maggie simply appears too cherubic to play a rough chick. I vote for Patch to be the Jezebel's unhinged leader! She's unreliable, deceitful, mean and stark raving mad. Awesome film, highly recommended to slavering sick puppies like myself."

The elaboration of the idea might be a little weak to make this pass for a controversial and/or criticizing parody, still several blackly humorous sequences manage to make you thinkand worry! So, pregnant women better beware! Cohen exclusively gives subtle hints on what the cause may be and merely focuses on the terror of a hideously deformed infant that goes on a killing spree straight from the womb. Our director also has a professional eye for the social isolation of the parents by the media, the merciless battue of the police and the hypocrite medical tycoons attempting to keep the possible causes secret. Meanwhile, a subtle subplot about the mother unconditionally loving her breed  no matter how hideous or evil  magnificently develops itself through all the other action-packed story lines. This aspect alone proves Larry Cohen's talent as a filmmaker and scriptwriter if you ask me! Tension is efficiently created through a chilling score and an imaginative cinematography (those sewer sequences!!) but the fans of blood and gore aren't ignored, neither.

638,tt0059170,/review/rw1275042/?ref_=tt_urv,"I've got to admit, after the first ten minutes or so; I really didn't think I was going to like this film. However, it isn't long before Russ Meyer's film takes off - and before I knew it, I was watching one of the greatest pieces of trash ever to hit the silver screen! If you want a B-movie; this film has all the essential ingredients. We've got fast cars, fighting, killing, snappy dialogue and a trio of buxom beauties in the lead roles! It's quite clear that this film is made purely for entertainment value - as the plot is non-existent, and the characters don't go any deeper than the common B-movie stereotypes, but it doesn't matter - because entertain it does, and this is about as 'cult' as it gets! Shot in crisp black and white, and with all the energy of the Nouvelle Vogue cinema doing the rounds in sixties France, Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill! (awesome trashy title) follows three women; dancers by night, and fast car riding killers by day! We follow them as they stumble upon an old farmhouse, inhabited by an old man as sick as they themselves. He's got some money hidden, and the lead chick wants it...only the old man and his sons stand in her way."
639,tt0059170,/review/rw0089149/?ref_=tt_urv,"I have watched and enjoyed most of Russ Meyer's output, and will quite happily defend his lesser works, but two of his movies have a life of their own and have managed to reach a larger audience than ""just"" card carrying Meyer nuts. They are 'Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls' and this one, 'Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!'. Both movies are trash classics and never fail to entertain no matter how many times you have seen them. 'Faster Pussycat!' really succeeds mainly because of the three strong leads, Tura Satana, Lori Williams and Haji. Any one of them would be enough for Meyer to plan a killer movie around, but all three together is dynamite! Satana, strangely enough, did very little movie work after this, mainly a couple of Ted Mikels turkeys. But it doesn't really matter because her screen immortality is assured. Her performance in this movie is more than enough! Williams also went on to very little, but she is very good here, and stylistically reminds me quite a bit of Erica Gavin in 'Vixen!'. In fact one could almost bet that if Meyer had been aware of Gavin when he made this movie she would have played the part of Billie. Haji appeared in a few more Meyer movies, including his masterpiece 'Supervixens', but this is probably her strongest role. All three women, who play go-go dancers by night, thrill seeking criminals by day, are simply wonderful and their chemistry and repartee are priceless. Meyer regular Stuart Lancaster is also in fine form as a dirty old man with more issues than a daily newspaper. There are so many unforgettable scenes in this movie it's difficult to single any out. The whole movie just rocks period. Many late 60s movies attempted to emulate a camp, comic book appeal ('Barbarella', 'Diabolik',etc.etc.) but in many ways Meyer beat them all, and did so without technicolor, large sets, multiple costumes, special effects and other gimmicks. Just crisp black and white photography and three chicks in the desert. Plus a brilliant theme song later immortalized by The Cramps. Russ Meyer divides most viewers. You either ""get it"" or you don't. If you aren't familiar with his work this is probably THE place to start. Watching this movie for many is a life changing experience! 'Faster Pussycat!' is one of the most original and entertaining movies made in the 1960s, and continues to amuse and inspire right into the 21st Century. Every time I watch this movie I am knocked out. This is a bona fide cult classic that gets better and better as the years go by. Absolutely essential viewing for anyone who loves exploitation movies, The Sixties, rock'n'roll and/or buxom babes!"

Most of it is quite watchable, it's not at all offensive, and the story - utterly ridiculous as it is - moves fairly quickly, and gives you some reasons to stick around to the end.  Those qualities put it well ahead of a great many movies that cost a lot more to make and that involved many more recognizable names than you'll find in this cast."

To me ""the worst"" would be one that was dull and has no entertainment value whatsoever. 'Plan 9' is the complete opposite of dull, and is it entertaining? You bet! It's still one of the greatest beer'n'pizza and have a bunch of your pals over movies ever made. Hell, it isn't even the most inept and bizarre movie Ed Wood ever made, that would still have to be 'Glen Or Glenda', which for some strange reason still doesn't have a tenth of the cult following 'Plan 9' does. Speaking of cult, in some ways 'Plan 9' is almost THE definitive cult movie if you consider that it virtually vanished without a trace when it was first released and it still lives on because it was subsequently rediscovered by thousands of enthusiastic movie nuts, collectors, journalists, cartoonists, rock musicians (e.g. The Damned), and other film makers (Joe Dante, Sam Raimi, Tim Burton). I think 'Glen Or Glenda' is Wood's most amazing achievement myself, but I still love 'Plan 9'. I've lost track of how many times I've seen it over the years. I wouldn't go so far as to say I have it memorized or anything, but it's always in the back of my mind. It's like part of the collective pop culture unconscious that I carry around with me at all times. As much as I love Bela Lugosi I think the three main reasons this movie is truly unforgettable (apart from the obvious -  silly aliens, laughably bad dialogue and ""those"" flying saucers,etc.etc.) are Criswell, Vampira, and especially Tor Johnson. Any three of those people being involved would have made this something special, but all three! Man! This is trash heaven! It's hard to believe there's anyone left alive who hasn't already seen this movie, but if by some strange twist of fate you are one of the uninitiated, you MUST, I repeat MUST watch 'Plan 9' as soon as possible!

Director/co-writer Mick Garris gets the pace cracking in the lively and exciting second half (the opening half alas drags quite a bit), stages the Crite attack set pieces with real flair, tosses in numerous witty dialogue references to other popular movies (""Who we gonna call?

Moreover, this bigger budgeted sequel boasts better and more elaborate special effects, with the famous giant man-eating Critterball rating as one truly impressive sight to behold. The solid acting by an able cast helps a lot: the lovely Liane Curtis is quite fetching and appealing as perky newspaper reporter Megan Morgan, Tom Hodge contributes an amusingly obnoxious turn as snotty punk troublemaker Wesley, plus there are nice contributions by Herta Ware as Brad's feisty grandmother, Lin Shaye as the ditsy Sally, and Eddie Deezen as a nerdy fast food restaurant manager. Insanely foxy and sexy blonde B-movie queen Roxanne Kernohan positively burns up the screen as alien bounty hunter Lee in ravishing human guise as a delectable (semi-nude) ""Playboy"" magazine centerfold. Mick's wife Cynthia Garris has a brief bit as prison warden Zanti and sings the uproariously goofy ""Hungry Heifer"" jingle.

Also the zombies were terrible, no where near as fun as any of Romero's work, who gets s plug in the movie. And the dumbest part of all was they kept showing flashes of the video game in the action sequences. Like we don't get the video game is about shooting zombies. Also, all the 20 somethings some how know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even aiming the gun. And the way the people die is so stupid.

Yes, certainly, this is the kind of movie where the creative mind goes all ways in every scene, adding the extra dimension only so few movies have of not only watching a movie, but being 'in' it.

Hardware is actually, even at this early age, part of a robot tradition. Star Wars had been around for a while, and then there was The Black Hole (1979), Saturn 3 (1980), and Short Circuit (1986). I'm giving this movie a 7 because it entertained, but if I were a real movie critic I'd give it less. Almost all the camerawork is in a close-up range, and the robots field of vision was way too spludgey, a sort of amateur Predator vision. We needed wider shots to really see the robot, and we needed to see more of the city itself, not just the crazy lady's crazy artist's loft. Anyway, that's my take. I liked the soundtrack and the human characters, they were all really suitably post-apocalypse, and the general story made sense in a sci-fi fashion, and the ravages of the droid were suitably outrageous.

The rest of the cast is adequate.  Zach Galligan gives his mediocre best in the male lead, but two stunning beauties supply something to visually feast on despite their lack of acting breadth. Michelle Johnson and Deborah Foreman do their level best to entertain.  The film is an obvious homage to the horror genre with all kinds of visual allusions to former horror films.  Anthony Hickox, the director, creates a fun horror film that I think his father Douglas Hickox, the director of my personal favorite horror film Theater of Blood with Vincent Price, would certainly have been proud of for its ability to mix chills with fun.  The film also has a nice cameo by Patrick Macnee, the old avenger himself.  Two minor flaws for me are the ending, which is somewhat too forced, and the bloodletting which may be a tad overdone at times.  Notwithstanding this criticism, one of my favorite scenes in the film is the one where the man who came to Dracula's dinner table(albeit minus much of his leg)agonizes in pain as he is prodded, poked, chewed, etc.. whilst a fight is going on around him.

I would argue that these were African-Americans making their own films and that they effectively broke or modified the stereotypes by taking them to extremes their own way. I think William Marshall is great in this film. He almost makes a better vampire than Bela Lugosi, but I don't know if I can put him alongside the great Max Shrek (""Nosferatu""). I was battling a case of the blues when I saw this,now happy days are here once again! Isn't that what movies are all about anyway? But, I do want to add one thing. Obviously, it is not an exceptional work of art. I gave it a 7 out of 10, but I did really, really enjoy this one!"

SCREAM,BLACULA,SCREAM! proved a worthy follow-up. The voodoo angle was a logical next step, and, for a kid whose preference was for fright films, it did not disappoint. And it STILL doesn't: I caught this one on a cable channel not too long ago, and I was surprised at how creepy it still is, after all these years. Pam Grier's character here is more sympathetic than the vast majority of the parts she's had over the years, and she is more than capable in the role. William Marshall is as majestic as ever. The direction is even better than in the original. All told, a sequel worth seeing."

Sure, the typical invasion from outer space was the theme of the film, but the bug-eyed aliens are so gosh-darn cute and the costumes so cool you can't help but smile instead of becoming afraid. And, the script also takes a less than serious look at the invasion. Sure, it is a dopey martian invasion movie but it makes no attempt to be otherwise and that is why I liked the movie so much--for what it was, it was sure fun.

Of course this is pretty stupid, but if you go into this expected anything else than inane and offensive trash, you only have yourselves to blame people! In a happy little suburban community, the middle-aged mommies suddenly all synchronously develop cannibalistic appetites and begin to devour their husbands and children. The cause of all this tomfoolery is a venereal infection caused by overactive and hyper-sleazy jogging Casanova. Oh he's quite the ""stud"", all right, especially with his massively hairy chest and smooth talking skills. The adolescents try to fight back, as well as a fugitive copper (the first reasonable man to shoots his cannibalistic wife straight through the head) and a really short coroner. ""Flesh Eating Mothers"" is a nice and tacky time-waster with cheesy gore effects that are explicit but nevertheless too absurd to shock anyone. For example, there's a particular sequence in which a bunch of women literally tear apart a security guard. The scene is gross but at the same time quite hilarious. Yeah, the execution is pretty clumsy, but hey, at least this film is a lot better than the similarly themed (but also enjoyable) ""Rabid Grannies"". The teenager characters are surprisingly likable and the goofy soundtrack is irresistibly cheerful. Also, the script contains a lot of really lame and clichéd humor that you can't help but laugh at. Even if they're cannibals, the women remain concerned whether or not they turned off the oven before leaving the house and even in between human meals they debate their silverware. The midget coroner finds love in the arms of a doctor's assistant who's about twice his size and, when seen through a microscope, the venereal disease looks like a badly animated cartoon. The absolute OTT offensive highlight of ""Flesh Eating Mothers"" features two hungry wives fighting over a cat and literally break it in two. Watch it, if you have a wretched sense of humor!"

I was under the false impression as I watched the kids cut that Woods did not add much when he made his cut. Watching Woods cut you see how much effort went into shaping the final theatrical cut. It's amazing that the actors, unpaid for 2 years, already constantly returning to remote sets to incrementally add to to the shot count, would ALL reassemble for the extra shots that Woods would want to add. Listening to Muren, Danforth and McGee knock their own acting and talent is a real crack up. Everyone involved obviously loved the doing of this film.

The intention of the producers of Redneck Zombies was to make a really bad movie. In fact, if anyone has the Troma DVD, they should watch the short interview with director,  Pericles Lewnes. He basically says they wanted to make a really awful gory horror movie.  Knowing that movies shot on video automatically come off as being cheesy, they went all the way with the bad acting, bad jokes, bad special  effects, etc. And that is why this movie has become one of the gems of modern  day b-movie gore flicks.

From the wiles of Tobacco Man, the prophet, the soothsayer, the deux ex machina...to the misunderstood but brightly optimistic Elly Mae, this movie delivers a multitude of beautifully executed, heavily obscured morals, which the viewer seems to pile up with every repeated viewing.

I could sit here and type all day about the bottomless toilet of flaws that this film actually is, like most would, but, for the most part, all that was intentional, so now, all we have left is entertainment value, and if that was all that counted in the film industry, then Mr. Lewnes would have an Oscar to his credit.

I found David DeCoteau's sequel somewhat a step-down in quality (which at times looked very second-rate), but probably a little more enjoyable if a tad creative in its story (despite a silly script, unintentionally humorous plotting and an abrupt ending). While still being one of the weakest, it skipped that childish feel of the recent ventures to only deliver on the nasty and gory quota with its nightmarish details (resembling the tone of the original features), but while the jolts and cruelty is there it seemed to meander on its characters interactions and the constant mystery surrounding a disappearance, which is rather predictable to figure out. The puppets have always been the stars and that's nothing new here, as the creations are well-used despite some obvious stock footage from other features. The uncanny appearances and personalities come through, although some are underused; The Jester and especially Leech woman. However there are plenty of images of the puppets cementing how they are best of pals. DeCoteau's practical direction is raw and threadbare, but there's a lyrical guidance that shows in some atmospheric visuals. Most of the performances are particularly lousy and over-enthusiastic, but Emily Harrison seems to be an exception to the trend."

Though it is basically a dark comedy--emphasize the word ""dark"" as much as you can--there are some moments of graphic violence that the casual moviegoer might not expect out of a comedy.  But not all comedies are meant to be like Mel Brooks movies.  Peter Berg explained it perfectly on the David Letterman show when he was talking about ""Very Bad Things,"" which he wrote and directed.

A major question, first and foremost: just what the hell was Vivica A. Fox doing in this movie? I've never used the word slumming before in a sentence but I think it applies here. Devon Sawa is a cool cat. I liked him here and his brand of physical comedy is pretty impressive. Watch Final Destination after seeing this and I think you'll wonder why we haven't seen more of him. Seth Green is cool and so are Elden Henson and Jack Noseworthy. And for Jessica Alba fans, she's in here, in all her pre-Dark Angel glory. I've never used the word nubile but I think it definitely applies here. She looks so good in this movie that it hurts my chest. She's one of the finer points (literally) of the movie. There's a chick in this movie wearing Paul Stanley's KISS makeup that should email me so I can give her my home address. There's parts of the movie that kinda fall flat but that's to be expected.

The movie does require major suspension of disbelief as some of the story elements don't work (for example: the honeymooner's car works just fine, but every other machine on earth, from lawn-mowers, electric knives, trucks, and even steam-rollers, go haywire). But then again, this movie is all about fun. The best part of the movie (besides Emilio) is that no one is shown any sympathy...not even kids; in one stand-out scene, a steam-roller comes out of nowhere and completely squashes this innocent kid.

A group of people trying to stay alive hold up at the Dixie Boy truck stop.

What we get here is a killer leprechaun so what does one expect?  A leprechaun who constantly says ""I want mi gold"".  Not an unreasonable request for the most part, though he does tend to go a little overboard with the killings to get what was stolen from him.  Then again he proves to be quite civil if you return his property, unless you short change him.  This made me almost pull for the leprechaun to chop open the moron who just had to swallow a piece of the leprechaun's gold.

Looking at it now as an adult you can see how laughably stupid it all is, but you can't help but still love it! The vision of Raquel Welch in her animal skin bikini nearly brought puberty on five years early for me.

But this movie is much more than that, a tour de force of imagination, and a heartbreaking work of staggering genius. The vision of man adrift in a hostile universe, at odds with his fellow creatures, his own untamed emotions, and the apocalyptic earth itself, is haunting and beautiful.

Whilst Lucio Fuci never had the creative genius of Dario Argento in Profondo Rosso, Tenebrae and Suspiria, he certainly knew how to make a good old fashioned zombie/gore movie. In Zombi 2 or Zombie Flesh Eaters (what a title!) as it was known in the UK, a ship drifts into New York with a very large, hungry zombie on board. This leads to two investigative journalists, including gore stalwart Ian McCulloch, with two holiday makers going to the Island of Matul. After meeting a shark wrestling zombie en route, they arrive at Matul where things are not going well. The hospital run by Dr. Menard has turned into a morgue where daily zombie killing has become the routine. Things go from bad to worse as the zombies grow in number and various dismemberment, eye gouging, jugular bites etc ensue. What makes this film so good are various factors. Apart from being one of the first gore films I ever saw, it has no social commentary or hidden meaning and does not try to be a comedy (although some may argue with this). It is a good, honest gore film. The special effects are nice and gruesome, with fantastic zombie make up, great zombie attacks and loads of maggots and worms. The crazy underwater battle between zombie and shark is totally original and not surprisingly has never been tried since. The infamous eye scene whilst a bit creaky still makes the viewer cringe. The acting and dubbing are dodgy but don't detract from the zombie mayhem, the music is great with calypso music to greet the heroes and throbbing effects to welcome the zombies. I cannot recommend this highly enough for good old fashioned zombie related thrills. Also look out for The Beyond and City of the Living Dead in a similar vein."

This may have inherently less artistic merit, but it does follow through on an intention that's impossible to ignore. In a way, maybe this always should have been the tone, as no one ever expected subtlety from a movie called Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It gets to the point quickly then proceeds with a relentless bludgeoning of blood and gore. Not achieving the comedic brilliance found in the excesses of the Evil Dead franchise, but thankfully not succumbing to the trappings of self serious torture porn. Also fun to realize how much Rob Zombie's 1000 Corpses movies were just as much an homage to TCM as his Halloween movies were to the John Carpenter originals."

I remember watching The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 as a kid, and it scared the s**t out of me. That opening bridge scene is incredible. It's one of the scariest sequences I've ever seen. Tom Savini's effects are top notch, the humor is well placed, and the acting is perfect for the genre. Bill Moseley (Chop Top) is something else. He's the reason I love this movie so much. He portrays one of the most memorable characters in recent horror history and I can't get enough of him. I do agree that Bill Johnson is not nearly as menacing as Gunnar Hansen in the role of Leatherface. But what's wrong with Tobe Hooper's direction? It's his story, let him tell it the way he wants to. I think Tobe Hooper succeeds in continuing the tale of one of the great horror icons. TCM 2 has loads of gore, campy acting, and instills a healthy dose of fear into it's viewer.

But despite all of this, I still found DEEP RISING to be a greatly entertaining film. While it's a little sad to see the apparent dumbing-down of cinema values, the fact remains that big tentacled monster creatures will generate audiences, so that's why films like this come out every couple of years or so.

If you like Elvira's style of comedy, this is the movie for you. No pun is left unacknowledged, no breast reference unaccompanied by a stare down at ""the twins"". Low-brow, silly and schlocky, just like the movies she hosts and celebrates.

It's this lore that intrigues an American named Cathy (Ilona Agathe Bastian), who seeks to know more about the powerful magic known as Leak, supposedly more powerful than any other form of magic. Well, she really gets in over her head, as the female Leak cult member whom she meets (Sofia W.D.) is willing to mentor her in all things Leak, but the horrific old crone mainly wants to use Cathy for her own ends. It's up to Cathy's good friend Mahendra (Yos Santo) to help save the day. The special effects in this thing may not always be terribly slick, but it's this very crudeness that makes them so endearing and, sometimes, hysterical. The audience may howl with appreciative laughter seeing the way that the crone manipulates Cathy's body, separating her head from her body on occasion and sending it out on killing missions. There are also a couple of transformations, as Cathy is shown how to become lower animals, such as a pig and a snake. The music, by Gatot Sudarto, is very atmospheric, as is the jungle setting; director H. Tjut Djalil handles everything with a certain degree of panache, ensuring that the stupefied viewer will keep watching.

It's worth sticking with this just to see how this wild story will resolve itself. While it was a big hit in Asia back in its day, it never got a proper release stateside as it was thought North American audiences wouldn't be able to appreciate its weirdness.

The film is a strange blend - with some genuine creepy moments and others that will have you unintentionally laugh out loud.

The conflict here is that when this movie was made, it was meant to be serious stuff. Man breaking the confines of the earth, exploring the moon and encountering hostile alien life forms. It's not exactly how the movie seems today. You have a hard time taking a space ship equipped with lockers, a desk, and old office chairs too seriously. There are all sorts of scientific bloopers in this film. Three men and a woman embark to land and explore the moon. What last minute preparations do you make? Well, naturally the woman has to fix her hair and another astute astronaut is thinking of selling souvenirs when he gets back home. It gets even funnier; they bring along cigarettes and for protection against who knows what, a revolver. The conversations are equally amusing. They sound as if the space explorers were picked up off the streets and asked, hey! you want to go on a trip to the moon? The landscapes and backgrounds are mostly painted but actually they did a pretty good job at that. They're not bad at all. Times have changed though and this film doesn't quite hit the mark that it was once intended to attain. If you try watching this as a serious sci- fi drama, You will be extremely disappointed. You can find faults and pick this movie apart until it is shredded to bits and you would be rightfully so in doing it. I suggest watching it with the understanding that it's a part of sci-fi movie history. View it with an easygoing fun attitude. Look for the blunders. Laugh at the cheapness and corny dialogue.

You see, this is one of those movies that has to be enjoyed in a theater, with a LOT of people, for maximum funness. It might be fun to sit around the living room and laugh at the campy dialogue and bad acting and VERY bad special effects with your friends, but to see it in a theater... well, there is no comparison.

The F/X are dazzling, the ... well, OK.  It's, shall we say, not quite up to some of the other sci-fi thrillers of that era, e.g., When Worlds Collide, War of the Worlds, From the Earth to the Moon, Rocket X-9, the Man from Planet X, etc., but it's a lot friendlier.

Weird lighting, fog, and sinister music really make the opening scene in an old cemetery quite effective. Michael Pataki makes a great vampire.

Curiously there is no middle ground for Dwain Esper, you either love his films or you hate them. He was no filmmaker; originally he was a real estate agent and one of his clients defaulted on a mortgage and left a house full of filmmaking equipment.  Esper was wondering what to do with all the stuff and suddenly the movie making bug bit him and that was that;  he had a new career. Dwain was no Edward D. Wood.  Eddie's films have a laughable ineptness but the sincerity was there despite the shortcomings, and they were legion. He wasn't even comparable with Andy Milligan whose filmic efforts make Ed Wood look like John Ford by comparrison.  If I HAVE to compare Dwain with someone it could only be David Friedman.  Both went directly for the cinematic equivalent of a heart punch and gave us images so unrelentingly gritty and brutal they dared us to keep looking. Having seen most of Dwain's movies I have to say MANIAC is his magnum opus.  Horace Carpenter, a former director of silent westerns (check out FLASHING STEEDS sometime) and member of Cecil B. DeMille's stock company (ROMANCE OF THE REDWOODS, JOAN THE WOMAN, etc) plays Dr. Mierschultz, the maddest doctor to step in front of a camera.  Bill Woods is his assistant, the dangerously neurotic Maxwell who is on the run from the police (we never find out why but Dwain was not one to clutter up his screenplays with needless facts).  Neither of these characters is playing with a full deck. Meirschultz restores life to a dead woman and wants to restore someone else by transplanting a living heart into a dead body.  When he demands that Maxwell shoot himself it brings an abrupt end to their employee/employer relationship and Maxwell kills him and decides to take his place (""I not only look like Mierschultz, I AM Mierschultz!  I will be a great man!"")  And this is where the movie gets REALLY weird! The film has lately been restored and it available on both video and DVD so I don't want to spoil the surprises; and there are a lot of them in the 55 minute roller coaster ride of a movie.  I will warn all cat lovers to avoid this movie.  There are one or two scenes that will bother them, but there is no animal cruelty!  That one eyed cat was a real one that Dwain bought from an animal shelter.  Dwain always claimed he was making educational films to warn people against drugs, promiscuity, and to enlighten people about mental illness.  He must have known it isn't WHAT you say but HOW you say it. So pop this cassette into your VCR.  Good luck to you all.  Viddy well, little brother, viddy well."
767,tt0025465,/review/rw1018520/?ref_=tt_urv,"This film is, in one word, DEMENTED! No matter how you try to look at it  either an early underdeveloped educative docu or an ambitious exploitation pioneer, you can only come to the conclusion that this is a masterpiece of awfulness! How else would you describe a movie that features images of fighting women in a basement (with baseball bats!) or a dude munching a cat's eye (which, by the way, has just been squished out)? The whole point of ""Maniac"" is giving some sort of anthology about all the possible mental illnesses through the adventures of a science assistant. Maxwell helps his employer with stealing bodies from the morgue and re-animating the dead tissue for the cause of science. When his boss (Dr. Meirschultz) becomes a little too obsessed, Maxwell kills him and replaces him in performing the art of mad science. In order to give the story an Edgar Allen Poe twist, he walls up the corpse and a black cat accidentally gets buried along. ""Maniac"" is one giant incoherent mess! Amateurish pacing, ridiculous dialogue and downright atrocious acting make it almost impossible to sit through this film even though it only lasts only a good 50 minutes. Bill Woods and Horace B. Carpenter overact terribly and especially their diabolical laughter is pathetic. And yetI had a great time watching it and I have a great deal of respect for director Dwain Esper's risky and ahead-of-their-time ideas. Being a massive fan of eccentric exploitation and bizarre cult-films, I'm convinced that could have enjoyed a much more positive reputation by now if it only had been made in the period of sleaze-deities like Jess Franco or Jean Rollin. The editing of silent German expressionism highlights into the film is quite eerie definitely well attempted. Maniac also contains a lot of gore and even nudity, which is quite spectacular for a 1934 film. So, if you're not too easily disgusted (either by kitsch or awfulness) I recommend tracking this deranged early horror film down! I sincerely hope everyone involved in this production ended up in a mental asylum and lived happily ever after."

Spectacle is furnished scenes such as a man popping a cats eye out of it's head and eating it, two women lounge about in their underwear, two women fighting with syringes!! Finally the last two scenes are nudie strip scenes, and are inserted for titillation sake only! Suicide recovery, cat chasing mouses, mad scientists, and a guy ranting ""rats eat raw meat--you know, cat carcasses...so the rats eat the cats, the cats eat the rats, and I get the skins"", are all part of this disjointed viewing experience everyone should see!!"
769,tt0025465,/review/rw1360070/?ref_=tt_urv,"I remember the first time I sat down to watch CITIZEN KANE many years ago. That movie had the reputation of being perhaps the greatest American film of all time, and I was sure I was going to be disappointed. I wasn't. It's a brilliant piece of film making that I've enjoyed again and again over the years, and one of the few times I remember thinking that a much-hyped film had actually exceeded its publicity. Last night I had a similar experience: I watched Dwaine Esper's classic MANIAC. We may be talking about the other end of the cinematic scale here but my reaction was similar: here was a movie I'd read about for years which not only lived up to the hype but surpassed it. MANIAC is a work of demented genius. I can't remember seeing another film that was more assuredly the product of a man unhampered by matters of good taste or conventional film making technique. It's one of the most consistently watchable and entertaining features I've seen, with an atmosphere more reminiscent of an old underground movie that a Hollywood production. The over the top acting, ludicrous but somehow clever dialogue, and nightmarish imagery (raving madmen superimposed over footage from silent horror classics, way ahead of its time gratuitous nudity, people being shot up with hypodermics the size of harpoons, and a killer catfight between two ferocious and seemingly indestructible women) all combine into a unique and surreal viewing experience. And yet the most shocking thing about this movie is the flashes of actual talent it displays (albiet sparingly). The sets and photography are occasionally quite atmospheric, and some of the dialogue, if competently delivered, would have seemed quite clever and original, foreshadowing the ""postmodern"" exchanges of people like Tarantino. All in all a movie that defines by example the word ""unique"" and an experience not to be missed."

In many ways the film follows the same action-orientated template with hostile rednecks replacing supernatural monsters and the heroes gradually picked off one by one by the bad guys. However, the realism of the film adds to the suspenseful aspect. Beginning fairly low key, we watch as events gradually build out of hand (Bava takes time to develop the situation instead of rushing it and making it unbelievable) until the rip-roaring climax that will please action fans everywhere. Before then, the film is packed with incident and genuinely manages to stay exciting all the while. The plot is not very complex and takes influence from a number of other films. FIRST BLOOD is the obvious choice, but there are also some surprising references to THE EVIL DEAD and even a western homage! "

772,tt0088818,/review/rw2064280/?ref_=tt_urv,"Having watched ""Blastfighter"", I can now proudly say for myself that I've seen the entire repertoire of lead actor Michael Sopkiw. Not that this is such an exhausting or praiseworthy accomplishment, as this peculiar macho star only ever appeared in four movies, but they are nevertheless rare and offbeat highlights in the category of shameless early 80's Italian exploitation cinema. Sopkiw's career was quite bizarre, because he only played four leading roles and then completely disappeared from the film industry, but the movies he did are forever printed in my head and all still rank high in my list of personal guilty pleasures. ""After the Fall of New York"" and ""Massacre in Dinosaur Valley"" are his two most superior achievements, whereas the double feature he shot with director Lamberto Bava is putrid but tremendously amusing cheese-material! ""Monster Shark"" is a daft and utterly retarded ""Jaws"" rip-off and this ""Blastfighter"" is an outrageously inane travesty of the Sylvester Stallone vehicle ""Rambo"". This is an incredibly askew and misfire of an action flick; hilariously entertaining for all the wrong reasons. The screenplay is incoherent and full of holes big enough to rush a reasonably large bobsled through, the inept dialogs make you go ""WTF?"" every couple of minutes and the overuse of typically 80's syrupy chansons is mildly infuriating. We open with Sopkiw's character – awesomely named Tiger Sharp, ha – walking out of prison after doing his eight years of time for murdering his wife's murderer. Why his wife died or in what sort of scandal Tiger got involved eight years ago we never find out. We just knew he was a cop in the Bronx and now he returns to his hillbilly-infested hometown somewhere in Arizona. At least I think it's in Arizona, because that annoying theme song repeatedly sings something about ""Sunset across the Arizonian border"". Anyway, Tiger promptly gets into conflict with a bunch of redneck lumberjacks led by the crazed brother of Tiger's former best friend Tom. George ""Anthropophagous"" Eastman depicts Tom and I truly, madly, deeply adore this guy! Tiger then receives a visit from his teenage daughter Connie (although it takes an awful long time before he realizes she's his offspring) and it looks as if he finally found some peace and quiet in his chaotic existence. But the vendetta with the rednecks escalates, and Tiger is unwillingly forced again to dust off his multifunctional machine gun. Watching ""Blastfighter"" is an indescribable experience and I only address myself towards fans of Italian exploitation cinema, because all the other 'normal' movie lovers are likely to label this as the worst movie ever made. Don't get me wrong, it IS one of the worst movies ever made but also amateurishly charming, irresistibly cheesy and the ideal piece of junk to watch together with friends. Every slightest aspect about this movie is unintentionally zany, like the wannabe sentimental moments with the Bambi deer, the ""Deliverance"" homage near the beginning, the continuously straight-faced acting performances, the exaggerated showcasing of hillbilly clichés, the copious amount of action sequences that look identical to ""Rambo"", the seemingly unceasing number of hostile lumberjacks that our hero is up against, the demented father/daughter interactions and the totally bonkers final confrontation with Tom. Michael Sopkiw is a handsome (kind of resembling Franco Nero) and reasonably talented actor and he probably deserved better than to star in trash like this. I can't possibly afford to grant a positive rating to ""Blastfighter"", but rest assured it's an entertaining and highly recommended film!"

774,tt0054668,/review/rw1749211/?ref_=tt_urv,"It turns out that all the word of mouth about the Mexican horror flick ""The Brainiac"" (1961) is absolutely correct: It IS one wild and loopy film experience! This picture tells the story of the necromancer Baron Vitelius Destera (played by the film's handsome producer, Abel Salazar), who is burned at the stake in 1661 by the Inquisition in Mexico City and swears vengeance on the descendants of his tormentors. Good to his word, the Baron falls to Earth in 1961 on a comet (the phoniest-looking comet ever shown on film, perhaps) to begin his homicidal agenda. Destera has the ability to transform himself into a giant-headed, pointy-nosed, fork-tongued monster, and his ability to hypnotize with a glance and bend others to his mental will makes his nefarious plans that much simpler. Oh...did I mention that the Baron uses his Gene Simmons-like tongue to suck his victims' brains out? Oh, man! Sounds pretty cool, right? Truth to tell, though, this film has been made on the cheap, with loads of ersatz-looking backdrops, lousy FX, and reams of unexplained happenings. Why, for example, does the Baron need to keep a stemmed dish of brains around for snacking purposes? How do the film's detectives ultimately crack the case of all these homicides? Why is fire able to harm the Baron in 1961 but not in 1661? Where DID that blasted comet disappear to? This movie has so many head-scratching moments, so many outrageous situations, so many admittedly cool murder scenes, such egregiously artificial backdrops and such strange humor (brain tacos, anyone?) that the net result is one of absolute lysergic surrealism. So yes, the movie is a hoot, and features a monster you won't soon forget. Unlike the Baron himself, the film is NOT a brain-drainer, but a genuinely exhilarating cult item. I, for one, was sufficiently impressed to check out director Chano Urueta's next effort, 1962's ""The Witch's Mirror""..."

The Baron curses the descendants of the four Inquisitors - Indalecio Pantoja (Germán Robles), Baltasar de Meneses (René Cardona), Reinaldo Miranda (Rubén Rojo) and Contreras (Miguel Brillas) - promising that he will return in three hundred years to eliminate them while a comet passes in the sky.

This hodgepodge of ideas has 'nice try' written all over it, but somehow director Chano Urueta manages to pull it all together into a somewhat fluid and invigorating film. The plot focuses on Baron Vitelius; a man put to death by fire in 1661 for a catalogue of anti-social crimes. He swears vengeance on his punisher's by stating that he will return the next time the comet passing over returns - and he does! 300 years later in 1961, Baron Vitelius comes back to Earth as 'The Brainiac', a monstrous brain-hungry creature that sucks the brain fluid out of the descendants of the people who killed him..."

Throughout the movie the troll disguised as the little girl moves from one apartment to the next turning each room into a seemingly new dimension or something.  The girl's brother has his suspicious and teams with this old woman to figure things out.  The old woman seems to know a lot and she looks a lot better with her hair down. Soon the entire apartment becomes part of this world the troll is creating and the boy must finish it off because the old lady just is not in the position to help at the end.

It also has a grindhouse feel to it as well, a very entertaining grindhouse type film. There is just certain elements in this movie that made it entertaining despite it having a bad script and not a very well crafted dialogue with one liners. When I first saw the trailer to this movie I already could tell it's going to be a bad movie, it looked like ""Gone in Sixty Seconds"" with a vengeance. The movie is ridiculous and absurd in so many levels, but for a movie like this that is one of the key factors why this movie is so enjoyable. Billy Burke is pretty good playing the cult leader but the most entertaining actor to watch in this movie is William Fichtner as The Accountant or the Devil's right hand man, he is great in this and I enjoyed every scene he was in. In fact I wouldn't mind seeing a prequel or a sequel to this movie where he is the main character. What I really enjoyed besides William Fichtner performance is the 3D effect, this is a movie that is well worth the extra cash to see it in 3D. The 3D is very well executed and used very well and added a lot to the entertainment factor. The sex scenes and nudity is very unique at times and kinda funny in others. Amber Heard is beautiful in this and hot, in fact I personally think the overrated Megan Fox has nothing on her when it comes to the level of hotness. Plus Amber Heard can act a bit better than Megan Fox, although she is pretty in other movies she is really beautiful in this. It's not a movie that should be taken seriously and it knows it's not going in a serious direction and does it well, with bunch of stuff that doesn't make any sense. If your looking for a good story you will be disappointed, but if your looking for a crazy and entertaining balls to the wall type of movie I recommend you see this."

824,tt0067229,/review/rw0117471/?ref_=tt_urv,"I caught ""I Drink Your Blood"" at a Times Square theater in New York in 1971. I was writing for a long-defunct but excellent film magazine called Filmfacts, where we covered every film given a theatrical release in the U.S.--running the gamut from the boxoffice blockbusters to the schlockiest of drive-in quickies.  Filmfacts was a scholarly publication--most of our subscribers were libraries.  For each film, we provided a complete list of cast & credits, a summary of critics' reviews, one-to-four stills (if available), and a thorough plot synopsis. Which is why I saw ""I Drink Your Blood,"" expecting another piece of low-budget garbage, and instead being treated to one of the most truly horrific (and little-known) thrillers ever produced.  Even though the obviously heavily-edited R-rated version was pretty strong stuff, it still put me through the wringer and I recommended it to the other members of the magazine's staff, who all loved it. The plot has been sufficiently detailed by other reviewers on this invaluable database, but, aside from urging anyone with a cast-iron stomach to sample this unique, feverish, gorgeously photographed nightmare of a movie (""Night of the Living Dead"" please step aside), I'd like to clarify the conflicting accounts of the prints of the movie.  The one I saw at the theater was rated R by the MPAA.  A few months later, I happened to meet a lovely actress named Iris Brooks, who had given a first-rate performance in the film.  We became friends and, on the anniversary of the film's completion, Iris invited me and some friends to attend a cast & crew party held at a Times Square theater around midnight (after the theater was cleared out) and the projectionist could show ""I Drink Your Blood,"" followed by a catered but unpretentious party in the downstairs lounge (apparently, everyone involved with making the movie, its grisly subject matter notwithstanding, had a great time and had formed many friendships during the film).  However, the print that was screened was not the butchered 'R'-rated version I'd originally seen but the director David Durston's (a sweet, supremely intelligent, friendly man, and a first-rate filmmaker as far as I'm concerned) unedited cut.  It was perhaps 8 minutes longer than the censored version shown at theaters.  The violent scenes were considerably more graphic and gory, and there were also some innocuous nude scenes that apparently gave Jack Valenti cardiac arrest, hence the butchered version that the distributor was forced to release.  I've read that the original, uncut version has finally been unearthed and will be released on DVD.  I heartily recommend that any serious movie buff should buy this film (in whatever version, it doesn't really matter) as soon as it hits the video stores.  It's a true 'sleeper' that deserves to be re-discovered and appreciated even 30 years after its initial, shoddily-handled brief release. ""I Drink Your Blood"" is some kind of deranged masterpiece but, despite its controversial elements (even today, it's pretty far out there), it's never offensive and the people who made it are one of the nicest and most talented group of individuals it's ever been my pleasure to meet!"

They both are raw and chilling explorations of the angry rural America. The location of this film looks like a giant swampy area, homed by underdeveloped perverted rednecks and other freaks of society. Neville Brand terrifically portrays Judd, the isolated owner of the Starlight Hotel. Judd suffers a bit from the incapability to communicate with people and the guests at his hotel are doomed to die as soon as they enter his facility. He also has a pet crocodile swimming underneath the porch of his hotel, which is a pretty convenient method to get rid of human leftovers A poor, rejected prostitute is the first to undergo Judd's murderous rituals. Her relatives soon come to search for her and are doomed as well. In the meantime, the croc feeds on some more unfortunate by passers. Although I regard this as Hooper's second best film, it doesn't come close to the power of TCMWhich kind of gives you an idea of how great I think TCM was! The settings and photography of Horror Hotel (one of the film's a.k.a's) look nasty and utterly cheap. Just as it did in TCM, this actually increases the macabre atmosphere and you constantly feel something wicked is about to happen. The characters  although pretty imaginative  aren't as convincing as the Sawyer family but they too seem to come running straight out of a freakshow as well! There's Judd of course, but also a very memorable Robert Englund who plays a retarded yokel with an obsession for anal sex. The scream-queen prototype Marilyn Burns returns as well before disappearing into actress-oblivion forever. The crocodile as well as most other horror scenery looks really cheap, but to me, this only increases the trash-fun value of this film. Highly recommended viewing as far as I'm concerned."

The sets are cheap and nasty, the acting varies from quite good to plain silly, the ""plot"" can basically be summed up as: people check into a seedy motel and get fed to a pet crocodile by its nutty owner, but you know what?

However on the whole I did enjoy Hard to Kill. The action is well choreographed and fun, the pace is not sluggish or dull as I admittedly expected it to be and the film doesn't look slip shod or cheap. Steven Seagal doesn't give an award worthy performance, but it is one that is intelligible and more energetic than he would become in outings like Out for a Kill. Kelly LeBrock is an alluring and convincing partner, and she works fairly well with Seagal, while William Sadler is also enjoyable.

An expedition of law enforcement officials and lead scientist Dr. Yamane (Takeshi Shimura) head to nearby Odo Island to investigate. There, a legendary mythical creature called Gojira, alleged to be responsible for the ship disasters, make his first appearance and begins a rampage on hapless Tokyo, threatening all of mankind. "

This film pretty much makes one think about what we are doing to mother Earth with all the pollution and war going on. Perhaps the thing that made this film great was that not only did it have great effects, but it also had a great story that made a great social commentary on what could have happened if the arms race continued to go unchecked. Besides the story about Gojira, you also had a pretty decent love story. Akihiko Hirata, does a good job of playing Serizawa, who is really the tragic figure in this film who must decide whether or not to use his weapon, which potentially was more dangerous than the monster itself. This film is definitely one of the all time classics and fortunately the original version will be released on DVD in September 2006."
853,tt0047034,/review/rw1249073/?ref_=tt_urv,"Along with the 1933-version of ""King Kong"", this original Japanese release of ""Gojira"" is THE most essential giant monster movie ever and one the very few horror movies that every film lover in general has to see at least once. Why? Because, it's so much more than just silly drive-in cinema with a cheap looking monster! This is dark and apocalyptic Sci-Fi with a nearly allegorical rant about nuclear warfare and the honest fear for new types of weaponry. But I really don't feel like going into the deeper meaning behind ""Gojira"", as it primarily is an adrenalin rushing and overpowering action classic that doesn't need intellectual defense at all. One of the many reasons why I love this film so much (and same goes for ""King Kong"") is that we don't have to wait a dreadfully long time and/or endure a large amount of tedious speeches before we see the monster we want to see! Godzilla makes his highly memorable first appearance after approximately 20 minutes (by stretching his neck over a cliff!) and, from then on, this is deliciously hectic and paranoid monster-madness! The little bugger is presumably the result of too much H-bomb radiation and lives in the depths of the ocean, near the island of Odo. But now he's heading for Tokyo with his unnameable strength, fiery breath and  oh yeah  insatiable appetite for destruction! Particularly this extended sequence in which Godzilla blasts his way through the Japanese capital, crushing buildings and setting monuments on fire, is very impressive and legendary. The actor-in-monster-costume works a lot better than any form of computer engineered effects and the carefully imitated Tokyo sets are truly enchanting. The absolute best aspect about this production is its powerful score, which makes Godzilla even more threatening. Great stuff! "

The team of Lustig ('Maniac', 'Vigilante') as director and the legendary Larry Cohen ('Q', 'The Stuff') as writer really worked well here. Each sequel is slightly worse than the one before - though still entertaining enough - and their latter day attempt to start a similar franchise with the overlooked 'Uncle Sam' wasn't as successful, though that movie was a lot of fun for me. Facially challenged b-grade regular Robert Z'Dar ('Cherry 2000', 'Tango And Cash') ""stars"" as Matt Cordell the Maniac Cop, but the real drawing card here are cult favourites Tom Atkins ('The Fog', 'Escape From New York') and Bruce Campbell ('Evil Dead', 'Crimewave'), who are both always cool to watch. The supporting cast includes the legendary William Smith ('Run, Angel, Run', 'The Ultimate Warrior'), original Shaft Richard Roundtree, and Laurene Landon and Frank Pesce, both regulars of Lustig and/or Cohen.

870,tt0072209,/review/rw0137959/?ref_=tt_urv,"'Stone' was a labour of love for adman turned actor Sandy Harbutt, a biker enthusiast who took four years to get the script written by he and his pal Michael Robinson (who incidentally plays Pinball in the finished movie) on to the big screen. Many have slammed this movie as laughable, but I say look, it's a low budget exploitation movie with many non-actors in the cast, and if you take that into consideration it's a pretty good effort. Just compare it to an A.I.P. movie from roughly the same period and it's not that bad. The acting ranges from poor to above average, and while much of it is obviously dated and even a little silly at times, it manages to give a fairly realistic look at the 1970s Aussie outlaw bikie scene. It was certainly given the thumbs up by many Australian bikers at the time, and that's good enough for me. A few members of the supporting cast went on to bigger and better things (e.g. Helen Morse, Bill Hunter), but most of the major players were biker pals of Harbutt and have disappeared from the Australian acting industry. Ken Shorter (who looks a bit like the late Bon Scott at times)  plays Stone, an undercover cop who joins The Grave Diggers bikie gang to try and find out who is killing them one by one. Shorter is one weak link in the movie. An ex-cop himself before acting he is pretty wooden and dull on screen. Much better is Harbutt himself who plays the Grave Diggers leader Undertaker. Also good is Rebecca Gilling who plays Undertaker's girl. Gilling was something of a TV sex symbol in the 1970s and looks beautiful, and yes, there is some brief but memorable full frontal nudity. The real stand out performance is by Hugh Keays-Byrne as Toad. Keays-Byrne was lured by Harbutt from a touring Shakespeare company and has lived and worked in Australia ever since, later playing Toecutter in 'Mad Max' and appearing in such cult favourites as 'The Man From Hong Kong', 'The Salute Of The Jugger' and 'Mad Dog Morgan'. He is terrific on screen from his opening acid freakout scene to his memorable final moments. Hugh Keays-Byrne I salute you! And I salute 'Stone', one of the most enjoyable movies ever made here in Australia. 'Stone' is a classic slice of 1970s biker exploitation and I highly recommend it."

Secondly, it contained shots of male and female nudity. Thirdly, it was extremely gory and violent for it's day. But, the biggest thing it had going for it was it's incredible bike stunts.(Have you ever seen a Kawasaki Z900 do a wheelstand?) There's some fantastic locations in and around Sydney, and the funeral procession is spectacular, but the opening 10 minutes, or so, will have you on the edge of your seat.

879,tt2724064,/review/rw2994386/?ref_=tt_urv,"Directed by Anthony C. Ferrante, Sharknado was a Syfy Channel made-for-television disaster horror B movie that somehow become more popular due to its outlandish concept and attention-getting title. As less, it's not a mockbuster as most Asylum productions are. After all, where else would you see a movie about a Twister that lifts sharks out of the ocean and deposits them in Los Angeles!? The movie is about Surfer and bar-owner Fin Shepherd (Ian Ziering) who sets out with his friends, Baz (Jaason Simmons) and Nova Clarke (Cassie Scerbo) to rescue his estranged wife April Wexler (Tara Reid) and teenage daughter Claudia Shepherd (Aubrey Peeples). On the way, they decide to try to stop the incoming storm by tossing bombs into them from a helicopter. Will the dumb idea work, or will the perfect storm overtake them!? Without spoiling too much, first off, I think Ian Ziering and Tara Reid might be a little too young for their characters. It's hard to believe that Matt (Chuck Hittinger) is the adult son of both April and Fin. The actor that plays Matt is only a few years younger than both Reid and Ziering. It's also a bit odd for the first half of the film trying to build up a romantic relationship between Fin and Nova. I guess, the writers were trying to do a metaphor, as Nova speak in a barely coherent rip-off Jaws monologue about being a victim of a prior shark attack of which she was the Sole Survivor and Fin just happen to have a shark name. Yes, when I think of shark hunter Quint, I think of a woman that hates her scar on her thigh, but gladly wear short shorts all the time. I find Nova's attention turned to Matt, disturbing after Fin reconciles with April. All the acting in this movie is pretty bad. At less, most of the half-been actors such as Ian Ziering got work. During the time of filming, he had another child on the way and he needed to work after not working for a long time. He wasn't that bad, but gees, half of the stuff, he did, is nearly unbelievable. Not only does Fin has improbably aiming skills, taking over several falling sharks that are several hundred feet with a pistol, but able to lit a pool on fire with kerosene. The movie jump the shark, literally when Fin manages to use a chainsaw to cut a shark in half as it falls on him. He also enters a shark's mouth and cuts his way out not only being unharmed himself. Yep, that was stupid, but epic. Even minor cameos like John Heard as George and Robert Rist as the Robbie, the bus Driver, got a paycheck by acting badly as stupid characters. The worst had to be, Tara Reid. She is just horrible in this movie. Not only does she play a bitchy character, but her deep, raspy voice is just annoying and dull reply. She can't act. She is basically useless in the film. I was really hoping she would get eaten. She even didn't wanted to help the kids on the bus. Wow! Just Wow. I can't believe how unlikeable, her character is. It's not all her fault. Most of cast had little to no emotion when anyone's death. The movie takes so many artistic license that this movie makes biologist cry! The reason why is sharks in this film seem to be able to survive on land and in the air, but also fresh water rather than salty ocean. Honestly, I don't know, how these sharks are able to survive such a huge fall from the sky in the first plan! These sharks are suicidal as hell like jumping out of water, swimming in 3 inches of rainfall or going through windows to kill people. What the hell? Why are they always hungry!? Also, this movie probably has no clue, how weather works. One minute, the surf is calm, then 20-30 foot wave crash thru windows at bars on the pier, then the ocean is calm. Streets are bone dry after a hurricane passes then, surprisingly, streets are flooded. Hurricanes pass in minutes. Did anybody bother watching the Weather Channel? Hurricanes hitting Los Angeles are very rare. The movie was trying to make a message about Global warming, but it's lost in the horrible visual effects. The CGI is just awful, both in the sharks design and others. The movie even has the guts to use badly edit stock footage of sharks in the wildlife. Honestly for a shark movie, most of the kills are from other things like getting crush by the Hollywood sign or getting run over by a rolling dismounted Ferris wheel. Lot of bad editing and horrible camera work. Anachronism will have a field day with this. The writing is pretty bad. Lots of bad dialogue with awful puns, or bad jokes. The worst is the period joke. Overall: Sharknado has become a cult film to the point that a sequel, Sharknado 2: The Second One will come out. People love a movie with an idea that is so preposterous and inconceivable that the only appropriate responses are to watch and laugh. Gloriously brainless, Sharknado redefines ""so bad it's good"" for a new generation. You just have to have suspension of disbelief to watch this movie. Enough Said."

It's the kind of fun movie they use to make in the fifties. That watch out for mutation monster movies. The kind that Roger Cormen and Burt I. Gordon use to make. But this movie took longer then the weekend to make. The creature effects were realistic and cool. The spiders had personality. The human cast does a great job, the radio guy and his alien talk got annoying. He totally believes in aliens but can't fathom mutations. A conspiracy nut like him should believe that radiation causes mutations, and if the Government covers aliens up they sure hell would cover mutants up.

Unlike some people, I liked Halle Berry in the title role, I liked the scene where she cuts off her hair and revealed her real self. Somehow she didn't look right with all that hair over her face. When she was Catwoman, she looked very sexy in that leather outfit. Now the script was weak at times, but I really liked the overall look of the film, with the splendid sets. The special effects were a bit ropey, and others where it looked part-animated, or like the Matrix, but they're weren't the weakest part of the movie, that was the script, which seemed rather muddled and trite. The supporting players, particularly Sharon Stone weren't that bad, and while slow-moving and predictable at times, neither was the plot. All in all, a fairly watchable movie, not the best superhero movie, but not the worst(Batman and Robin). 6/10 Bethany Cox."
891,tt0327554,/review/rw4604465/?ref_=tt_urv,"24 July 2004. I had doubts, but Halle Berry makes a perrrfect catwoman with her moves and feline behavior. Though a terrible basketball player that stunt doubles or special effects can't hide, her transformation into Catwoman is one of the best personality changes besides The Fly. The action is good, Sharon Stone's script is a little weak though it's good to see her back. The ending is suggestive of Spiderman. Halle isn't so much erotic or sexual as sensual as she herself has described. There isn't so much sex as wild, unbridled heated freedom with enhanced senses. I would think perhaps, this movie might be too threatening for men and a bit out of the box for women. Yet, as a movie - the transformation of the independence of cats into a inhibited, passive women into her own is a powerful message and experience that Catwoman manages to capture. Seven out of Ten Stars."
892,tt0327554,/review/rw3268748/?ref_=tt_urv,"The reputation of Catwoman really goes before it. And unless you have been living in a cave, you will know that that reputation is not good. Halle Berry famously actually turned up to the Razzies to collect the worst actress award for this (hats off to her for that), although she then used it as a platform to blame her agent for getting her involved in the film – could she not have read the script herself? (Hats that were taken off for her are put back on again). Anyway, it almost doesn't need to be said that this is a pretty obviously clunky and shoddy film in many ways, with cheesy scenes around every corner. It has a bad script, poor direction and not very good acting. It's not helped much if you think back to earlier depictions of Catwoman from Lee Meriwether (Batman: The Movie (1966)) or Michelle Pfeiffer (Batman Returns (1992)), both of whom were effortlessly cool, slinky and sexy, whereas Berry justisn't so much."

I can still recall spending many days and nights watching it on television. I probably had no idea of what was going on, but I just loved watching this animal lover named Dar rescue the hot Tanya Roberts while fighting against an evil priest. Marc Singer is great in the title role. If he were to cure world hunger, create world peace, or even be elected president, he would still be known as The Beastmaster. Tanya Roberts doesn't really do much, but looks damn nice doing it, John Amos is also good as a traveler who befriends Dar, and Rip Torn is as over-the-top as he can get. Lee Holdridge's score, composed in a short amount of time, provides a bit more epicness than the film could have created on its own, with a heroic theme that is used throughout. I was also happy to learn recently that Anchor Bay Entertainment is working on a Special Edition DVD of THE BEASTMASTER.

John Amos from Roots and Good Times cheeses it up but damn, do I have a soft spot for the guy. Dar looks like my brother Eric. Rip Torn is a villain with bad teeth!

This movie unquestionably has the most absurd premise in cinema ever and you either love it or downgrade it as being a ridiculous piece of trash. I am a great fan of this campy horror-comedy flick and I can't possibly say anything negative about it. My best defense for this movie would be that it is an ingenious and successful attempt to parody and homage the 50's and early 60's SF classics in which paranoid people witnessed alien-invasions from all over the universe. But actually, the silliness of this movie doesn't require justification at all. It feels like the idea started out as a joke between 3 brothers and eventually it resulted in a long-feature film. The acting isn't very impressive (apart from veteran actor John Vernon in a great 'angry old copper'-role) and the dialogues are unimaginably dumb. On the other hand, the clown-costumes are terrific and the least you can say about the plot-twists is that they're creative (a Godzilla-clown, anyone??). So, in case you have only the tiniest sense of morbid humor in you, I strongly recommend tracking down this ""Killer Klowns from Outer Space"".

To be honest, I can't say I was overly enthused with this Sci-Fi spoof, but it's not hard to see why it's got a cult following. The film takes in the idea of clowns being eerie and frightening, and fuses it with the common theme of aliens coming down from space; thus giving us aliens that look like clowns. For what it is, the film is actually quite inventive; and while much of the action is clichéd and/or samey, it's the little things that ensure it doesn't get boring. As mentioned, the plot follows aliens from space that look like clowns. When their spaceship (a tent) lands in the forest, two kids rush to the police headquarters to tell the law that their town is being invaded. If someone gave me that story, I'd definitely believe it; but the law in this town is slightly more sceptical, and while the kids aren't being believed; the clown population is growing."

Truth be told, this is a film which doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and the human characters are very much left in the background.

Holland mutates into a half-man, half-plant hybrid creature called Swamp Thing (amiable Dick Durock in a nifty rubber suit) after being drenched with his serum by suavely wicked arch nemesis Anton Arcane (delightfully played with lip-smacking hammy relish by Louis Jourdan). Swamp Thing protects brassy CIA agent Alice Cable (a marvelously tough and sassy portrayal by Adrienne Barbeau) from Arcane and his nasty flunkies. Writer/director Wes Craven handles the cheerfully silly premise in a suitably garish comic book style, keeps the pace snappy throughout, stages the plentiful action with rip-roaring brio, delivers a strong and vivid evocation of the murky marshland setting (the authentic South Carolina locations are a major plus), does a sound job of creating a hugely entertaining tongue-in-cheek tone, and tops things off with a welcome sense of self-mocking humor. Moreover, Swamp Thing makes for a strangely moving and sympathetic protagonist; there's a real sense of heart evident in the depiction of his lonely plight that's both touching and surprising. The cast have a ball with their broadly drawn roles: Barbeau is a brash treat as the fiercely self-reliant heroine, Jourdan chews the scenery with eye-rolling gusto, David Hess excels in one of his standard sleazy villain parts as the vicious Ferret, Nicholas Worth likewise does well as the doltish Bruno, and Reggie Batts almost steals the whole show with his very natural and amusing deadpan performance as hip, but laid-back black teenage gas station attendant Jude. In addition, this film comes through with a few inspired outrageous touches: Bruno becomes a pathetic midget monster after drinking the formula, Swamp Thing has one of his arms chopped off, but grows a new one in its place, and Arcane transforms into a crazed werewolf lizard beast that engages in a lively to-the-death climactic fight with Swamp Thing.

The setup is a tad confusing as it shows this military man seemingly having a grudge or something against the clan in the hills, and this is never really touched upon. However, like the first one, the movie is very bloody and the action comes at one fast and furious. Still a bit far fetched that the family from the first one seemed to handle themselves a tad better than national guardsmen, but then the guardsmen don't have an ultra cool German Shepard to help them out. I liked this one as it was very fast paced and gruesome, I mean from the opening credits you know you are in for a gruesome time. Most of the action in this one takes place in a mining system and this along with the troops are a couple of differences.

If this shouldn't be possible, try and gather as many friends together for a drunken movie night, but whatever you do, don't watch this cheerfully repugnant and positively demented movie all by yourself as it is too much of a crowd-pleaser! The formula of laugh-evoking zombie splatter movies isn't new (even Nazi zombie movies have been done before, for example ""Shock Waves"" and ""Zombie Lake""), but spirited and ambitious young filmmakers never cease to invent original variations on the sub genre. Norwegian director Tommy Wirkola took his cast & crew high up north, for a splatter film in a beautiful and isolated snowy setting. A group of medical students – that are also die-hard horror movie freaks – trek to a remote mountain cabin for a weekend of snow scooter fun, drinking and casual sex. The first night of their arrival already, they receive a visit from a mysterious and grumpy old local who tells them a grotesquely absurd story about sinister events that occurred in the area near the end of WWII. The atmospheric tale says that fed up villagers combined forces and chased their Nazi occupants into the mountains where they all froze to death. The clique laughs away the warnings, but subsequently discovers a box of old coins that promptly resurrects an army of Nazi soldiers in a far developed state of decomposition. The first half of ""Dead Snow"" is slow-paced, atmospheric and full of little tributes to classic zombie movies; particularly ""The Evil Dead"" movies. The students are standard horror stereotypes, including the nerd and the blond bimbo, and thus the first half also contains childish pranks and gratuitous sex sequences. As soon as the Nazi zombies emerge, however, ""Dead Snow"" is a non-stop spitfire of blood, gore and intestines. Apparently the production of this film required 450 liters of fake blood, and that isn't nearly so surprising if you watch the end result. There's chainsaw action, decapitations, rope pulling with intestines, axe murders, machine gun concerts and disembowelment. The effects are top-notch in spite of the obvious budgetary restrictions, and the make up art on the zombies is very impressive. The rotting uniformed corpses look quite menacing, especially their leader. The snowy landscapes are beautiful picture to behold, although it's even more amusing to see the white snow color red with blood!

Steve develops incredible strength and resilience, is given a costume and shield, and is rechristened Captain America. The Cap fails spectacularly in his first mission, which is vanquishing Red Skull (Scott Paulin), the adult version of that Nazi experiment.

However, I think Salinger gives an honest performance as the title character, even if he spends more time out of costume than in.  For whatever reason, the Red Skull is made Italian, rather than German, but it didn't bother me as much as it did some other viewers. For being a B-movie, Captain America is tolerable.  Watch it first, before you make any judgements.  You might be able to suspend your disbelief long enough to enjoy it."
981,tt0103923,/review/rw2439341/?ref_=tt_urv,"Okay, so after watching the Republic serial from 1944 in which Captain America's alter ego was Grant Gardner, district attorney, and then two TV movie versions starring Reb Brown as Steve Rogers, occasional painter, I finally watched this 1990 version from Menahem Golan's 21st Century Film Corporation starring Matt Salinger as the super soldier from World War II that gets frozen for several decades before being thawed out. I liked the beginning where we find out about both his and The Red Skull's (Scott Paulin) early lives and there was a quite entertaining fight between them during the WWII sequence though it would have been nice to know what dastardly thing the Skull did that lead to that battle. But then we're abruptly taken to the present day to when Cap finds himself waking up to and it takes a little time to once again find some momentum. That said, having Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty as a couple of old pals now serving as president and reporter, respectively, was a nice treat for anyone who remembers them from Deliverance not to mention Beatty for his previous superhero encounter in the first two Christopher Reeve Superman movies. And how awesome it was to finally see the CA costume done right this time with both the wings on the cowl and the shield just the right size and color. Even more so was all the hot women that abounded though I have to wonder how any of them could realistically be daughters of the disfigured Red Skull! So in summation, this filmed version of Captain America may be a little on the underwhelming side concerning story logic but the action for the most part makes it worth it for at least one viewing though I probably wouldn't mind watching it again. Can't wait for Chris Evans in Captain America: The First Avenger later this summer."

The more famous one of course is Who Framed Roger Rabbit, a glorious gem of a film that gets the acclaim, notoriety and long lasting attention, as it well should. (We won't speak of a third one involving a certain moose and squirrel that really does earn it's bad rap). Cool World is somewhat maligned as the black sheep of the two, and in some people's eyes (Ebert laid a stern smackdown on it) downright hated on. It's no doubt very different from Roger Rabbit, which is admittedly the better film and the easier one to like and relate to. But this one is brilliant in its own right, at least for me. I love the way it uses a sombre tone with its human creations to throw a unique light on them as soon as the Toons show up. It's quaint and wonderfully inaccessible, with some scenes existing purely of a need to showcase a stream of consciousness type style that doesn't so much halt the proceedings, as give them their own surreal flavor. Brad Pitt is Frank Harris, victim of a jarring post war tragedy and thrown headlong into the cartoon world, eventually finding himself a Detective in their realm. Outside in our world, lonely cartoonist Jack Deebs (Gabriel Byrne is a sly choice for the role) falls in love with one of his creations, a blonde bombshell named Holli Would (voiced and later played in the flesh by Kim Basinger). Holli is as devious as she is gorgeous, and works to use Jack's attraction to her as a conduit to escape into our world. Pretty soon a deafening cacophany of cartoon creatures in all shapes, sizes and colours floods out of their dimension and into ours, creating quite the cosmic mess for Pitt to clean up. It's fun without being too zany, the overblown fuss of the Toons contrasted by a glum human world, reeling from the war and unexpecting of such an event to unfold. Granted, the meshing of the two dimensions isn't given the precise, big budget fanfare and cutting edge methods of Roger Rabbit, but the world building and special effects here are still pure enchantment and offer a dazzling level of entertainment. Pitt is stoic with flinty sparks of boyish charm, Byrne hilariously plays it dead straight, and Basinger is dead friggin sexy. She steals the show especially as Holli in human form, having a ball with the bubbly bimbo trying to keep a straight face in the real world. The Toons in general really are a diverse bunch, ranging from animals to inanimate objects to tiny little formless cutesy blobs and everything in between, filling their frames with a chaotic, detailed miasma worthy of Studio Ghibli. Lot of hate floating around for this one. You won't find any from me, I love the film, and accept it for the adult friendly, experimental oddity it is. Great stuff."

Unless you go back there or some more guys from there come here, in which case you become immortal here again."""
992,tt0102034,/review/rw1065963/?ref_=tt_urv,"Never in the field of human endeavour has there been an act of such instrumental, destructive, diabolical folly as this justifiably reviled, quasi-sequel to the original 1986 fantasy in which immortal warriors duelled throughout the ages until one remained. Yes, its Highlander II - a film so bad that Robert Mugabe refused to show it to white farmers on the grounds that it would be ""exceptionally cruel"". Needing to grasp on to a strand of optimism, perhaps only the thickness of a human hair, I long ago decided that the film existed purely as a textbook demonstration for future filmmakers on how not to make a successful sequel to a hit movie. This theory alone explains the cynicism on screen and the ham-fisted, slapdash, car-crash handling of the material. Don't misunderstand; I'm not saying this thing is poor - poor would be generous praise for a Frankenstein fantasy in which all the invention, both visual and conceptual, inherent in the first film's appeal is frittered to nothing. In fact, the totality of the words already used are only the merest fraction of those required to accurately portray the near total devastation that washed over me as I sat through it (I'm ashamed to say not for the only time) on a stormy night 14 years ago. Russell Mulchay deserves to be poisoned and broad beaten with a tent pole in the male ruminations for his decision to helm the whole sorry affair and grind his original good work to dust. It hardly needs saying but the problem for anyone scripting a Highlander II is that Highlander I concluded business comprehensively with no outlet for a second episode. To get around this the makers of The Quickening simply decided to ditch the back-story of the original film and invent a new one which would enable them to write around the fact that all the immortals, bar M.Lambert were, not unlike themselves, dead from the neck up. So although McCloud was originally born in Scotland and Ramierez in er, Egypt, now they were aliens from a planet called Zeist; handy, because this new ancestry meant that all that was needed to reengergise the concept was that another visitor showed up on Earth and the games can begin again. To fully appreciate how awful an idea this is you need only imagine a Star Wars sequel in which the action is suddenly set in present day Earth for reasons of plot convenience or a second instalment of Titanic in which it's revealed that Jack and Rose are actually time-travellers and are thus able to prevent the disaster and save all their friends. Thus Highlander II is effectively the one line joke in the Player in which the writer of the Graduate pitches the terrible sequel writ large and for real. We can only imagine that the owners of the original film were desperate for more because nothing but desperation could possibly explain how this made it to the screen. If blame were slurry and required apportioning by EU agricultural directive then you'd need roughly 6 tankers worth, each containing somewhere in the region of 40,000 tonnes. The shame of Sean Connery and Christopher Lambert is palpable and everyone who felt any enjoyment during this picture is consciously and deliberately complicit in its evil work. As a purely commercial enterprise with no respect or consideration for the 1st film or its fans, we can only hope that all involved lost millions and that having lost their deposit they were forced to sell themselves into sexual slavery. Highlander III, not exactly itself a great sequel, ignored this one completely as ironically it left no outlet for a third episode but it too was a cynical cash-in and could only continue the first film by ignoring its ending whereas the forth in the series simply didn't bother with the first film at all, opting instead to go with the spin-off T.V series. That's the way the rot spread but here's where it started - now please Hollywood...never again."

996,tt0107978,/review/rw5412296/?ref_=tt_urv,"All I need is 20 seconds to comply. This American cyberpunk action superhero film written by Frank Miller of comic book fame & directed by Fred Dekker is a guilty pleasure of mine! Set in the dystopian future of Detroit, Michigan, the plot centers around RoboCop (Robert John Burke) trying to save the city from falling into the hands of a corrupt armed force created by his creator company OCP called the Urban Rehabilitators under the command of Paul McDaggett (John Castle). Without this 1993 film too much, this third movie in the 'RoboCop' franchise was a tepid attempt to make future installments in the series more family oriented by aiming for a PG-13 rating. While, I know a lot of people hate that Orion Pictures did that. They need to understand why they did it. The majority of the fan base were primarily children who readt the comics. So it make sense to market it to them as Orion was having financial problems. Plus there was a TV Show in the works so they needed all the eyes that they can get. Although the move seem likely to succeed. Sadly the movie bomb at the box office as it face tough competition from other children target movies like 'The Nightmare before Christmas' that debut one week earlier. To make it worst, Miller upon finding out that his script was yet again heavily altered from what he originally wrote; abandoned the film & swore off Hollywood for a very long time until 2005 'Sin City' was in production. Despite that the motion picture still maintain many of the comic book writer's dark ideas such as corporation funded militarizing of the cops forcibly relocate residents into camps without the ridiculously trashy, bleak and mean spirited nature. However the gritty foul language of the piece was cut down to cheesy insults that doesn't sound like it should be coming out of the mouths of criminals. Regardless of that, I was glad that some of Miller's edgy satire Meta humor toward the media & commercialism is still there and uphold the same style from the first two films without the overused of gratuitous T&A. Women are lot more respected here even if female characters like police officer Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen) isn't given much of anything to do besides being the key that drives Murphy to seek revenge. At least they made diversity female characters like Bertha (CCH Pounder) into a somewhat of a badass and made Dr. Marie Lazarus (Jill Hennessy) into somewhat of a heroine. As for Remy Ryan as Nikko Halloran. She does seem like annoying John Conner Terminator 2 unrealistic hacker rip off and perhaps the most extreme example of a studio trying to get children to see the movie. Nothing against the actress, but I found her character to be shallow and stereotypical. The villains were a mixed bag as well. Rip Torn replacing the old man played by Dan O'Herlihy in the last two movies didn't really add anything nor was his absence explained. Plus the whole stereotypical Japanese company meager felt too cartoony for my taste. To add onto that, I really hate the snail paced duel with the Japanese robot Otomo (Bruce Locke). It was awkwardly done. That action scene could had been done better like 'Ghost in the Shell' style. If anything John Castle was perhaps the best one of them all. I love that lowrider car chase with his character. As for Robo Cop, it's kinda sad that Peter Weller didn't return to play the titular protagonist. Robert John Burke played him pretty robotic bland despite the character gaining most of his past personality from the last two movies. Did I miss something here? Did he get his memories erased yet again before this film started because direction 4 is also back? It's never explained much like how the residents can't hear the giant wrecking ball about to hit their houses in the opening. Despite that the majority of the action scene with him were alright. This include the street battles between the police and the Rehabs. It was somewhat cool to watch even the jetpack flying climax was a bit disappointing because how fake looking the green screen flying was. I love the ridiculous funny moments as well like RoboCop's car breaking through and jumping from concrete parking lot. Follow up with him shooting the roof of his car to get out and got roasted by Molotov cocktails. It's so over the top. I was laughing my head off, much in the same way he plow through the broken elevator door later on or get a pimp car totaled. It's has that it's so bad, it's good vibe. Despite me liking the movie, I do have to agree with Miller that the film was a fire hydrant and a row of dogs did urine on it. Regardless we can all agree that the music is always great to listen to. I'm so glad to see original composer Basil Poledouris returned to do this film. He brought back many of the recurring music that were missing from the second flick. Overall: While 'RoboCop 3' is indeed the most terrible movies from the franchise even worse than the 2014 remake. It's far from being totally forgettable. There is plenty of things in the film worth watching. In short while I can't recommended viewing for all viewers.

Much of the overall film feels as though something exciting is about to happen but is unfortunately lost to draw in viewers to the the message the film and studio try to push. It is unfortunate this is a missed opportunity, the cast were also an issue in that they were selected for attracting a younger audience.

It's a similar film in quality to ANARCHY too, with Frank Grillo's assured lead carrying us through another fraught and frenetic journey through the dark and murderous streets as his security specialist tries to protect the life of a crucial anti-purge politician. Once again this is a lean, pared-down thriller with plenty in the way of graphic violence and little in the way of extraneous sub-plots or characterisation to get in the way. It's a film filled with action and twists, gritty violence and characters both good and bad; I enjoyed it as a popcorn movie, a watch-once kind of experience."

They are forced to participate in a sadistic game called ""31"" for 12 hours, and whoever survives will be released. Soon they are attacked by sadistic killers dressed like clowns. Will someone survive to the ""31""?"
1019,tt3835080,/review/rw3547145/?ref_=tt_urv,"I had no anticipation or information about this movie going in... except for it being a Rob Zombie movie and my enjoyment of all his other movies so far. None of them are perfect but none of them are boring, all of them bring something interesting to the table. Not so much with 31 though... One thing I've generally liked with Zombie's movies is that, unlike a lot of horror films such as Hostel - which promise all sorts of transgressive horrors only to bait and switch with some relatively tame eyeball gouging, Zombie's movies generally follow through on their threats. I never feel safe in his movies (except I'm pretty sure Mrs. Zombie's characters will survive to the final frame). Unfortunately, 31 let all the air out of that balloon dog for me. It didn't ever come close to crossing any lines of standardized horror. Oh sure, Its clown's show up and promise all sorts of vile entertainments... but they never materialize. Instead, we get some badly filmed fight scenes and routine kills that could be out of any war/crime/fantasy film. There's little or no suspense, barely any atmosphere outside of the clowns' initial entrances and Malcolm McDowall's nonsensical prattling. The movie takes its time building up 'Doomhead' but what is he but another loudmouthed guy in a clown suit? I assume he'd go down just as easily to a well-aimed blow to the head. There's really nothing special about him except for the amount of time he gets on screen. He even does the loathsome 'golf clap' routine that should be forever banished to Cliché-land. When the clowns do get their hands on someone they're not likely do do anything surprising at all... just stab them and move on. Unless something nastier was edited out of the version I saw... which I kinda doubt."
1020,tt3835080,/review/rw3560661/?ref_=tt_urv,"Saw this on a pirated DVD for 50 rupees. Rob Zombie's The House of 1,000 corpses was good and The Devil's Reject's was better. I was disappointed by the Halloween remakes. Yet to see Lords of Salem. I was hoping that 31 might be his best. I was totally wrong. This is a very boring, unoriginal movie. There is no character development, you really don't care who kills who or why. The worst was the editing n camera shots. The quick-cut, shaky-cam gave me a headache. I almost fell asleep. Couldn't make out what was going on. The movie had excessively annoying hand-held shots and bad editing. Most of the scenes were shot in dark. One cannot make out the place or the set up. There was zero tension. Zero suspense. It was simply not scary at all. Zombie's wife, Sheri cannot act. I mean she can't even cry or scream properly. The story was lame. There was no proper explanation given. The ending tried to be more ambiguous but failed."
1021,tt3835080,/review/rw3443320/?ref_=tt_urv,"Here are a couple of things that must have gone through Rob Zombie's mind whilst shooting 31: ""Who needs a plot when you got a psychopathic Nazi-midget?"", ""Who gives a damn about plausibility when you have Malcolm McDowell himself dressed up like a French Aristocrat and depicting a character that is named Father Murder?"" and ""Why would I make ambitious when the crowd simply wants sadistic & graphic violence?"" And you know what? If Rob Zombie really was thinking these things, he was damn right! Personally, I'm an enormous fan of Zombie's ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"" and I remotely enjoyed his remake of ""Halloween"", even though the critics were quite harsh about it. But then he suddenly went psychedelic and experimental with ""Halloween II"" and ""The Lords of Salem"" and many fans – yours truly included – were disappointed. I, for one, was extremely happy to read that, with ""31"", Rob Zombie would return to the basics of crude and repulsive horror/shlock cinema! Because, after all, the revival of 70s grindhouse/drive-in exploitation cinema was largely the deed of Rob Zombie and not of Quentin Tarantino! So, ""31"" actually doesn't a have a real plot but is a mixture of homages to genre classics (for example ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"") and borrowed ideas of cult classics (""The Most Dangerous Game"", ""The Running Man"") "
1022,tt0978764,/review/rw3680598/?ref_=tt_urv,"I'm already giggling picturing the cries of protest that will rise up when I post this review, but the hell with it, I really like Zach Snyder's Sucker Punch. I never deliberately play the contrarian, I just seem to often gravitate towards films that have been maligned by the masses, and I can't really help it. Now, in this film's case, a few of the many and varied negative criticisms are somewhat warranted, yet blown out of proportion when you really take a good look at the story. The film is pure style, and although Zachary might have let his imagination run a little wild and clutter the whole affair with fanboy fantasies and video game visuals, there is a clear and discernible story beneath if one cares to look. Now, the only way that story is entirely comprehended is by watching the extended director's cut, which includes an absolutely crucial, pivotal scene that's should have never, ever ended up on the editing room floor for the theatrical version. Seriously, they we're straight up asking for hostility and confusion by not keeping it in every cut of the film, it's just common sense. Speaking of story, here we go: the film opens in breathless style and classic patented Snyder slo mo, with young Baby Doll (Emily Browning) trying to save her little sister from their tyrannically abusive stepfather. Outsmarted and shipped off to an austere mental institution, her journey is a sad, surreal and somewhat befuddling one, but there's a method to the madness that might not be clear with only one viewing of the film. The asylum she is sent to is plagued by a sinister orderly (Oscar Isaac) who is abusing the girls in his care, and as a result, Baby Doll channels such horrors into a grandiose set of fantasy worlds, the base of which rests on a burlesque style brothel where she and others work for volatile pimp Blue (also Isaac). Joined by Amber (Jamie Chung), Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone) and Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), she blocks out the reality of what is happening and replaces the details of an elaborate, systematic escape attempt with impossibly epic, highly stylized adventures, each of a different theme or set in a vaguely familiar period of history. Battling medieval dragons, giant samurai golems with mini-guns, WWI zombie hordes in a gaunt, bombed out European landscape, it's all a detailed rush of sound and fury that hits you like a ton of bricks, and although is far too much for the film to handle and still get its point across, it's completely dazzling stuff, especially on Blu ray. Guided by a mysterious Wise Man (a kickass, rootin tootin Scott Glenn) who shows up in a different get up each time and mentored by brothel Madam of sorts Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), each setting holds the key to move along a certain cog in their plan, correlating back down the line of delusions straight to the asylum, if a little tenuously. Now it all hinges on the arrival of the High Roller (Jon Hamm), a rich playboy who has come to the brothel to see Baby Doll dance, and probably more. Here's where they messed up royally: The scene I mentioned earlier is a monologue from him that is pretty much one of the most important parts of the film, capping off both realities beautifully, and without it, not only is Hamm relegated to basically a walk on extra, the entire final punch of the climax is rendered lost and neutered, not too mention quite uncomfortable in a sense. Whoever was in charge of that particular piece of the editing should be tarred, feathered and run off the studio lot by teamsters. With the scene left in on the extended version, however, the story is given both point and purpose, feeling like a complete vision with a little weight to go along with it's Hindenburg sized bag of visual tricks. Not Snyder's best for sure, but it's in no way close to the turkey some people will have you believe it is. Whiners. Style over substance? Yes, I'll definitely concede there's an imbalance, but don't try and tell me the whole thing is bereft of substance at all, because that is a lazily researched argument. The soundtrack is a treasure chest, I might add, with beautiful covers of Sweet Dreams and Sing Me To Sleep sung by Browning herself."

Once they are dispatched she finds herself back in the asylum; apparently her dance was amazing. She then tells the girls of her plans to escape and together they work to get the items; each time the try to get one Babydoll distracts people with her dance; during which times she is transported to a different fantasy world where she and the other girls battle a variety of dangers and any failures have consequences in the real world assuming anything we see after her arrival at the asylum is real."

Still, I thought it would be cool to see a live action He-man, which I remember reading about in my He-man monthly magazine. What graces the screen is a mixed bag. You find yourself saying 'that is pretty cool' while at the same time going 'this really isn't much like the cartoon'. The film was released by Canon, which is odd mainly due to the fact they mainly released 'R' rated, over the top violence and bloody movies during this time. Here they release a children's film and do so with a rather large budget...over 20 million. They cast Dolph in the role of He-man and had a few other stars of note in what would be a doomed franchise in that it never made it passed the first initial film."

1065,tt0936501,/review/rw2085607/?ref_=tt_urv,"Since the entire plot of this film is given away in the masterfully delivered trailer, it's not divulging anything to say that Taken is a modern-day revenge thriller. This presents an interesting experiment, actually. Considering that there aren't really any surprises to be found in Taken, beyond those we were offered in the pre-release snippet, are splendidly realized action sequences enough to carry this film? The answer here is a resounding ""yes"". Taken may be a simple film, but it's not simplistic, and even though the first third of it is spent recapping what we knew going in, the second and third acts here deliver enough thrills and action to make this film riveting, even if we know exactly where it's going."

But when I was more grown up, I watched this film again, I figured since I loved the 3 previous Batman films, why not give this one another shot? Now, seeing this movie once again, I can understand the low rating on IMDb, this movie was just a pathetic attempt at merchandising Batman and making an over the top action movie that really had nothing to do with Batman. The casting was just oh, so plain wrong. We have Arnold Schwartzenegger as Dr. Freeze?! Not to mention the accent, the character was just someone you felt like you could laugh off. Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl, she was alright, but again, questionable casting since she seemed out of place. Now, George Clooney?!

This movie successfully recreated the feel of the game, and because it kept exposition to a minimum of what you needed to know for this particular story and didn't borrow from or revise any of the original characters or settings, it supported and strengthened the franchise. No story is retold here, no words are wasted, the setting, feel and pace is familiar to fans of Resident Evil and yet it's perfectly accessible to those unfamiliar with the broader storyline.

Of course, there's exceptions (such as The Shining and Carrie-both of which were poorly remade), but one that makes the book look like string cheese is Dreamcatcher. The book was 1000 pages of hit-or-miss horror, and the movie condenses it into two and a quarter hours that takes most of the best parts from the book. Having doubted William Goldman's ability since Marathon Man and the partial butchering of Misery, but since he's writing here with director Lawrence Kasdan, he can't foul up that badly."

Four childhood friends make their annual trip to a hunting cabin, weird things happen, and, before you know it, you're smack-dab in the world of Stephen King, at his most darkly comical and gaily grotesque.  It's flatulent, bloody fun on the page, and Goldman had no problem translating this hideous orgy of gas and guts from novel to screenplay form.  As the screenplay proceeds, it strays from the book to the point where the film becomes a Hollywood embarrassment of epic proportions."

Its ridiculous, preposterous, with plot holes the size of cannon balls. You could pick this film apart until there was nothing left of it but angel wings and dirt. So here is the thing. Legion was incredibly entertaining! The action was wicked and intense, the characters were fun and intriguing, it was gory and action packed so despite everything else I had fun. You basically have to let go of everything to go into this film. And some people can do that because a movie is not always art, or full of message and morality, a film can also just be absolutely nothing but entertain and for me Legion did exactly that. Upon retrospect of the film you'll start to realize the startling amount of errors and plot holes but I think a movie should be reviewed mostly on its first impression like when you're sitting in the theater. The unfortunate side to the film is that it misses the incredible potential of this epic good vs evil battle by making the story rather convoluted and underusing the characters of Michael and Gabriel."

His partner is the also honest, efficient and wealthy Detective Mike Lowrey (Will Smith), who inherits a large amount from his family and although living like a playboy, has not resigned to his position in the police department. After a daring robbery of heroin from the police department stores, the two detectives try to find some clue about the gang. The chance appears with the hooker Julie Mott (Téa Leoni), the witness of the murder of a 'working girl' friend of her. The detectives are assigned to protect her and chase the killers. Although full of clichés, 'Bad Boys' is an excellent action movie, in the same line of 'Lethal Weapon'. There are lots of funny parts, Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are excellent as the two partners with different behaviors and Téa Leoni is gorgeous. I saw this movie a couple of years ago, when Will Smith was an unknown actor, and now I saw it again on DVD, with the intention of watching 'Bad Boys II'. My vote is eight."
1131,tt0112442,/review/rw0355907/?ref_=tt_urv,"The 'buddy comedy' genre is fairly well-known, there have been plenty of them, all of them primarily based on the basic idea of having two main characters who are, well, buddies; they act like friends to each other, they get in fights, they help each other out, they compliment each other. It's a fairly easy genre to master, and an easy way to make a good movie. This is one of the best examples, since Smith and Lawrence really do compliment each other so well; Smith's the sleek, cool one who is popular with the ladies, while Lawrence is often nervous, and pretty much a direct opposite of Smith. They have pretty good on-screen chemistry, too; you believe that these are good friends and partners. My only real problem with the film is the way the comedy almost all is generated by stereotypes, and, worse, the age-old complications that arise from certain situations. I think that's a little unoriginal, but, hey, that's the only complaint about it, and the film does have some very entertaining comedy parts. The plot is pretty good, it keeps the film going and supplies every single scene with comedy, action, or both. It takes off immediately, and keeps a good pace throughout the 2 hour duration. The acting is all pretty good. The characters are well-written, well, for stereotypes at least(because, lets face it; they are). The comedy is well-done and often made me laugh out loud, and, believe me, I am not, in any way, shape or form, a Will Smith fan. The action was well-done too, intense and exciting. The film, all in all, was pretty good, very entertaining. For a buddy comedy, it's good. For an action comedy, it's good too. I recommend it to all fans of action comedies, and buddy comedies. 7/10"

I completely understand why this movie got such terrible reviews; after all, it marked the first ""let's make a quick buck"" entry in the two beloved Alien and Predator franchises and was done by a director who many felt didn't treat the material with the respect it deserved. When I watched it yesterday I got angry at times because some of the dialogue - well, most of it, actually - is truly awful. It's hard to take characters or a story seriously when nearly every sentence spoken resembles lines from a parody of cheap science-fiction and horror movies from the fifties and sixties. But despite all those flaws I have to admit I enjoyed the movie from start to finish - because of the amazing set- and creature-design and the more than decent action sequences and special effects. Whoever designed those really scored and seems to have a great love for the art of Giger and the previous films. So if you can get past the silly characters and you're able to ignore the more obvious shortcomings (like the idiotic decision to make the film PG-13) you're in for a fun ride. My vote: 6.5 out of 10."

For many, this move towards a crazier style with even more unbelievable splatstick violence will be a step too far, the live-action-cartoon style antics exceeding many people's willingness to suspend disbelief. However, those who can find their way safely past this potential stumbling block should have a whale of a time."

I actually saw this movie before the first Machete so I wasn't sure what to expect, and I laughed until it hurt. Seriously, it was everything I wanted in a silly action movie. Machete Kills is somehow even more ridiculous than the first one, this time with president Charlie Sheen ordering Machete to go after a lunatic nuclear arms dealer played to perfection by Demian Bichir, and Mel Gibson wants to destroy the world and colonize space. Yeah, and you thought De Niro playing George Bush was crazy. Mel Gibson is basically a Bond villain in this movie. "

1147,tt0109040,/review/rw0334171/?ref_=tt_urv,"Ace Ventura is the kind of comedy that stems directly from a TV show, and in this case, that show was probably In Living Color, where Carrey got most of his publicity before he became famous as a movie actor. A quick look through Carrey's filmography will prove that Ace Ventura is the film that really acted as a springboard for his career. He had a few small roles in films previous to Ace Ventura, the largest of which was probably his role as one of the aliens in the awful film Earth Girls Are Easy, but after Ace Ventura, his career skyrocketed. The Mask (hey, he's still new, give the guy a break), Dumb & Dumber, a sequel to Ace Ventura, Liar Liar, The Cable Guy (oops), The Truman Show (ah, better), Man On The Moon, Me, Myself & Irene, The Grinch, and there's no end in sight."

He's the right man for the job but his childish idiosyncrasies, uncanny bond with animals, and aberrant investigative techniques cause outsiders to question whether or not he can actually make good on his word. Aimed mostly at fans who really enjoy silly humor, others will quickly find it tiresome.

That chandelier spin in the early part of the movie was classic, like a roulette wheel of death administered by Frank Castle (Ray Stevenson) to a mob in the midst of a power struggle. The movie might have gotten a little carried away with itself when Billy Russoti (Dominic West) became Jigsaw, at which point it often approached the level of parody, especially whenever the 'Punisher Task Force of One', Martin Soap (Dash Mihok) was involved. The guy seemed so inept you had to wonder how he remained on the force as long as he did. The same thing with Loony Bin Jim (Doug Hutchison); all throughout I couldn't get rid of a nagging suspicion that he might have been modeled on the personality of a crazy North Korean dictator. My criticisms though, didn't impact on my enjoyment of the picture. I like to see the bad guys get their due in any kind of action thriller, and this one supplied it in spades. I don't know what The Punisher might be up to these days in the pages of his comic books, but if you like the sick along with the slick, you'll probably go for Ray Stevenson's take on the iconic character in this story."

If this trend continues, there won't be a building left standing in the whole of North America once Transformers is through. Not bad for a smug little geek with a rubbish haircut."

Sure, there's not much of a plot but if you wanted that why would you go to see this film?? The only reason to see this film is because you want 2 1/2 hours of entertainment!!!   That's what this is, pure fun."
1168,tt0172156,/review/rw5500529/?ref_=tt_urv,"Bad Boys II doesn't reinvent the wheel, it just makes it bigger, faster, and more attractive. The film is little more than a collection of high intensity action scenes with a tons of irreverent humor and mild characterization tossed in between. It's slick, high energy fun and a huge success for what it is and wants to be, which is, essentially, the quintessential Michael Bay experience."
1169,tt0172156,/review/rw1026449/?ref_=tt_urv,"I think us movie buffs sometimes forget that not all movies are made to have some sort of under lying message that can or will change our lives. That's why it pains me to see some users give this film a bad review because ""the dialog is weak"" or ""the scenery isn't vibrant"" or something along those lines. This is not a stab or an insult to you, but what I'm saying is; sometimes movies are made with one intended purpose... ENTERTAINMENT! I could careless if this film had poor actors, poor script, poor lighting, that doesn't matter when you watch an action film. This movie delivers your monies worth too, in my opinion Will Smith and Martin Larwence make such a great team that part of the fun is just watching these two get into it from time to time. And with Michael Bay directing, you know you're going to get some good action scenes. Let's face it, Bad Boys II has one of the best car chase scenes ion recent history, it dominates the dismal over played chase in Matrix Reloaded which was the other big summer sequel of that year. I think all that needs to be said here in a retort is the movie is an action movie ans needs to be looked at as an action movie. To hell with the elements that the Academy looks at, appreciate the film for all the stuff that blows up and the laughs the cast can bring you to."
1170,tt0402022,/review/rw1972255/?ref_=tt_urv,I decided I had to watch this film when the reviewer I listen to said that other reviewers who said it was the worst film of the year were mistaken... he also mentioned Charlize Theron's costume but my wanting to watch the film had nothing to do with that... honest! I'm glad I decided to give it a go as it was a lot of fun even though it is rather silly. The action was fun to watch and the acting wasn't bad.
1171,tt0402022,/review/rw6136404/?ref_=tt_urv,"For those people already familiar with the animated series please forgive me for giving a brief introduction to those people who have not experienced Aeon Flux before.
The franchise is based in a future world, and the series focused on Aeon and her arch nemesis/love-of-her-life Trevor Goodchild who is the leader/dictator of this future world. The series was very much a freaky, psychedelic, mind-bending collection of odd stories, some of which the plot is verging on impossible to follow closely. Thankfully the film, in an attempt to become more mainstream has gone for a easier-to-follow more Americanized plot, so if you're hoping for more from the giant baby from the series or the creatures that make mind-erasing pills then you may be disappointed. That is not to say that the film is not without its odd gadgets or odd scenes, such as the conversations that Aeon has inside her mind with her boss, or the woman with hands for feet."
1172,tt0402022,/review/rw1294633/?ref_=tt_urv,"When I originally heard of Aeon Flux, it sounded absolutely terrible. The posters looked even worse. However, after seeing a trailer somewhere, I loved the look and bright colours (being easily pleased) and decided to give the movie a chance. "

1176,tt0112851,/review/rw2159767/?ref_=tt_urv,"Rodriguez follows up 'El Mariachi' with 'Desperado'. Many seem to have preferred the raw look that 'El Mariachi' had and while 'Desperado' is more 'sophisticated' in the making and more polished, that doesn't prevent it from being an awesome action entertainer. For me, it was just as much fun as 'El Mariachi'. Rodriguez does what he does best. He already mentioned that his Mariachi films are a tribute to the western cinema that names like Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood defined and 'Desperado' works perfectly with its comic book story, quirky characters and over-the-top action sequences. Moving at a rapid pace, the direction and editing are top notch. The cinematography is brilliant too. Antonio Banderas does a good job taking over the role from Carlos Gallardo (who sort of plays his sidekick in this one). However, it is Salma Hayek that steals the show even though the story is dominated by El Mariachi. As Carolina, she is sensual, witty, charming and quite clever too. Hayek delivers a very natural performance and owns each and every one of her scenes. In addition, there are some wonderful cameos by Cheech Marin, Quentin Tarantino, Steve Buscemi and Danny Trejo. Overall, 'Desperado' is full throttle entertainment. This is what an action entertainer is supposed to be."

1178,tt0985694,/review/rw3431781/?ref_=tt_urv,"Machete is one of the funnest movies I've ever seen. Right from the beginning you know this movie doesn't take itself seriously. It's essentially a live-action cartoon with A-list actors. You have Danny Trejo - the antithesis of a leading man - carrying the movie as Machete, the unkillable badass Mexican James Bond. If you want to talk plot, this is basically a revenge story. Steven Seagal kills his family, then years later Machete gets caught up in a political scandal where Robert De Niro is playing a cross between George Bush and Donald Trump, and somehow Seagal's character is pulling the strings. It's as amazing as it sounds. Then you have Don Johnson as the head of border patrol or something, mowing down Mexicans all over the place, and Jeff Fahey as one of Seagal's enforcers in Texas. Now you may be thinking, ""Four villains? This sounds more convoluted than Spiderman 3!"" And you'd have a point if this was a traditional action movie, but it's not. At all. It's a comedy more than anything with some ridiculous action sequences and gratuitous T&A all over the place. These characters just serve to forward the plot, and to give us some belly laughs, and somehow it all works beautifully."

The ghosts were unusual enough to be memorable and there was not a lot of familiarity to the plot. This was very nearly an excellent film with a solid cast and very good effects. Five or ten more minutes of scary interaction between the ghosts and the children(if you can call Shannon Elizabeth a child) would have made the movie much better. I call it a near miss which is as good as most horror fils can aspire to.

I think Matthew Lllard was a good actor in this movie. I don't care what people say that this movie is dumb, and stuff like that. I think this film is better than Prom Night (2008) it wasn't a very good movie at all but Thirteen Ghost is better like in the movie they weren't over-doing it like running, and hide but this movie they ran into a room with spells that the ghost can't come in.

Someone message me and explain the massive hate around this because I can not see what is wrong. This is pure fiction. Is there something disrespectful here that I am missing? Anyway, this is a fun piece of fiction with mostly great action, good acting and a great script. The film moves along nicely and there is never a dull moment.

Boy was I wrong I fell in love with this flick, and have seen it many many times and have it in my collection. It's cinematography, its acting, action, and story is great.

1194,tt0195714,/review/rw7929260/?ref_=tt_urv,"The one that started it all: a franchise of over-the-top ""action,"" outrageous gore, and characters you often couldn't care less about. Yet in this one, none of those really apply. The death scenes are in ways subtle and clever, sometimes drawn out to exacerbate tension, while others are arguably very predictable, but nonetheless thrilling. The plane scene is chaotic and how it culminates, very intense. Aside from one decapitation, not much gore. Meanwhile the characters, in my opinion, are the best the series has had to offer, particularly thanks to Devon Sawa, and the personality he elicits in Alex Browning. Others satisfy, too, from Sean William Scott to Kerr Smith. There's some subtle humor, some drama, and some creativity to be had. As much praise as I have to offer the movie, it still has its many flaws and even silly moments. But for what it's worth, it was the beginning, and it remains a fun watch despite the slew of even more over-the-top installments that followed it."

But I decided to give it a fair shot anyways, and I'm glad I did. House Of Wax was actually an entertaining well made horror film. The plot was cool and intriguing. The actors were well casted, and I enjoyed all the characters and the actors playing them did a good job, yes, even Paris Hilton did a pretty good job. The movie was never boring, it always kept you interested and on the edge of your seat. The violence was a bit too graphic at times, but overall it wasn't that bad, other horrors have been far worse when it comes to carnage. Now it's not like the movie was flawless, it did have some flaws. The acting in a few scenes was kinda lackluster, could have been better if they would've just tried again I'm sure. I know a lot of people thought Paris Hilton was going to just be terrible in this movie, in my own personal opinion, I actually thought she did pretty good In her own respective role. She did get to dance around in her lingerie in 1 scene, so you straight guys out there, there you go. For the ladies and gay guys, do not despair, there is definite eye candy for you as well. Chad Michael Murray is one of the main stars here, who actually acts well and looks hot in his role at the same time, hard to find in a horror movie! So does Jared Padalecki, he does well in his role, and looks good doing it. This movie is just a good time for horror movie fans. It's not poorly made or cliché, or cheesily acted. 7/10 for house of wax."
1199,tt0397065,/review/rw1198239/?ref_=tt_urv,"As a lover of the horror genre, i found House of Wax quite refreshing. It is a cheesy style remake of a classic and doesn't really do anything that i've not seen before, but it has an Ora about it takes sets it apart from a lot of the mediocre horror flicks in recent times."
1200,tt0397065,/review/rw6207950/?ref_=tt_urv,"One of the good horror movies. I don't know why people are complaining so much. Acting is fine, the horror is there, there's enough suspense, the plot is okay. I really enjoyed it."
1201,tt0397065,/review/rw3702497/?ref_=tt_urv,"House of Wax (2005) is a remake of 1953 film and in my opinion it is very solid underrated best slasher film of 2005 that come out in recent years. That is my one of my favorite slasher horror films that come out from year 2000 I am not really in to 2000's horror films, but this movie, My Bloody Valentine, The Hills Have Eyes remakes, than The Collector and of course just recently Don't Breathe horror movies that come out last year are my favorite horror films and I think they are very solid and decent good films. This film doesn't deserve the hate, people knew who Paris Hilton was, R-rated horror movies were actually being released in theaters more than they were today, and horror movies were being remade left and right. "
1202,tt0119345,/review/rw5464021/?ref_=tt_urv,"So I might not like this movie as much if I were watching today for the first time. My opinion is biased by the fact that seeing this in the theater was just about the most fun I've had at a movie. That nostalgia is part of what I enjoy about it, but there are other good elements as well. For one, I like Jennifer Love Hewitt as a scream queen. Actually, that might be it. It's not big on story, the performances aren't anything special, and the kills are pretty tame. I'm giving it a seven based on my personal enjoyment of it, but I'm not recommending it for horror fans for the reasons stated above."

This is one of my favourites of those 90's slasher flicks, i love the cast & the BRILLIANT atmosphere & music & the excellent small fishing town location setting!!! The movie has a darkness to it,a real sense of dread & with the old worn down looking fishing town makes this a great slasher,the setting is beautiful & similar to the little fishing coastal town in the Fog (1980) so that's a very good thing!!!
Ben Willis is a scary killer too & very iconic & memorable with his wet looking fisherman coat & hook!!! Very cool & menacing looking.
Yeah this movie was a huge summer hit & when i finally brought it on video i loved it & watched it many times on a summer night, a perfect summer time slasher & one of the best made & actually a very well acted proper Thriller with real drama & characters within the slasher parts & that's why this stands up way above most of the rest of the 90's slasher wave, but i think Robert Rodriguez's The Faculty is the best of those.
This was made to be very good & not just another teen killer flick.
Last summer also stands out for having real serious drama & sense of threat,you really feel for the damaged characters & their lives!!!
Other good 90's slashers are of course Scream & Scream 2,The Faculty, Halloween H20 & Urban Legend these stood out as excellent well made slasher films & are all great"

As a dinosaur loving kid growing up in the Fifties I got hooked on these flicks with the original 1954 ""Godzilla"", or ""Gojira"" if you will going with the Japanese translation."

So when there was news about a feature movie based on Spawn was in the works, it was naturally thrilling news. And furthermore, with New Line Cinema involved, it could be nothing but good. Right? Well, while ""Spawn"" certainly has its moments, it is not without its flaws. And believe you me, the flaws in this movie were monumental."
1211,tt0120177,/review/rw3871879/?ref_=tt_urv,"There was a time when comic books were not celebrated. When only the disenfranchised cared or knew about them instead of the mainstream. And in those ancient times — let's call them 1992 — no news was bigger than when Marvel's biggest creators left en masse to form Image Comics. At the time, these artists were derided as style over substance. Many of them weren't known for hitting their deadlines. Or even how to draw feet properly. But one of them — Todd McFarlane — took the opportunities that his new home presented and made the most of them, creating his signature character: Spawn."

The set looks good, the characters look good, the cape looks REALLY good, but the story? Other than telling the origin and the standard ""must stop the bad guy"" motive, it doesn't do as much as it should. And yes, I know it's a Hell-based movie, but the metal soundtrack just got distracting and annoying, instead of enhancing the story like it should have. John Williams or Danny Elfman it wasn't."

When it came out over 15 years ago, it stunned audiences with its color scheme, being so different from anything else that had ever been put on film. Those colors, for me at least, make this an absolutely fascinating film to watch. There are literally thousands of scenes I wish could freeze and somehow convert them to a painting to study for their artwork."
1215,tt0099422,/review/rw2903171/?ref_=tt_urv,"Labor of love for star and director Warren Beatty, Dick Tracy was a film I hated when it first came out. I was a kid and stupid, only caring about what's cool. What was cool then (and sadly still is) was ""dark and gritty"" heroes like Batman. Dick Tracy was considered corny and lame. When I first watched it I thought it was a kids' movie and I was at that age where anything like that I hated. Happily, I feel much differently about the film now that I'm older."
1216,tt0099422,/review/rw0280597/?ref_=tt_urv,"This is a marvelous film.  Warren Beatty managed to film it just like a comic book MIGHT be brought to film with humourously grotesque and bizarre characters, beautiful colours, and a plot that really only could have come from a comic book.  The buildings, set design, make-up, and props are like nothing I have ever seen in film before.  Now, never having read the original strip leaves me out as far as making probably very insightful comparisons with this film and the original source.  That being said, I think that Beatty, although drastically changing some of the villains in the film to fit smaller roles, tried to keep the spirit of the film inside the comic strip.  Does that make sense?  Probably not.  Anyway, Dick Tracy offers a lot.  It is a visual feast with a decent story and some prime time stars doing some things you may not expect from them.  Beatty is very good as the lawmen, but much of the supporting cast steals many scenes from him. Al Pacino as Big Boy Caprice is sensational as an over-the-top thug out to get every criminal under his control, while he intermittenly quotes folks like Nietchze, Jefferson, and other historical figures.  Dustin Hoffman as Mumbles is wonderful - if you can finally figure out that it is him(notice in the scene where a stenographer is taking down what he says((That is Oscar winner Kathy Bates!))).  James Caan has a brief yet good scene with Pacino Godfather style and Beatty gives Michael J. Pollard and Estelle Parsons cameos as well(both co-starring with him in Bonnie and Clyde).  Then there is Madonna.  She tries her best to live up to her name of Breathless and does a VERY credible job at it.  And then of course there is the music of Stephen Sondheim, an Oscar winner for this film.  It is very good and in some ways more memorable than much of what goes on in the film.  Perhaps a song here or there might have been cut, but for the most part the music greatly added to the overall effects created in the film.  Is Dick Tracy great?  No, but it is a whole lot better than it is generally given credit for.  In some ways its innovation must be reviewed again.  I think that for its type of film it is one of the best."

Giving a new sense to the concept of color in a movie, we are offered an unique experience throughout a comic-strip world, and it's one of the few movies which succeeded in doing so, thanks to a serious script, good direction, great performances (Al Pacino is astonishing) and most importantly a powerful mix of cinematography, art direction and costume design. Using only primary colors, the experience is quite different from anything we have seen before. And there is also a quite successful hommage to all the gangster-movie genre, pratically extinct from modern cinema. Overall, I see this movie as a fresh attempt and a touch of originality to a cinema which relies more and more on the old and already-seen formulas. 7 out of 10."

After reading a slew of reviews that trashed this movie, I decided to watch the movie and judge for myself. Apparently, what I watched significantly differed from what these other reviewers had seen. This movie is obviously a spoof on the Men-In-Black movies, with Jeff Bridges reprieving his Rooster Cogburn role, this time in a character named Roy, with highly amusing results. Indeed at times Bridges performance is hilarious as he and his sidekick Nick bicker and exchange taunts and insults when not destroying ""Deadies"" who have escaped back to earth. Although Ryan Reynolds co-stars, Bridges dominates the movie. His performance is so strong that he overshadows every other cast member in the movie. Although some of the special effects are cheesy and most of the story is hokey and contrived, such as the love interest between Nick and his wife which really stretches literary license to the limit, the movie nevertheless is engaging and keeps the audience's attention. This is the case because despite his gruffness, Roy is an engaging character. Mary Louise Parker and Kevin Bacon perform wonderfully in supporting roles, with Parker demonstrating a talent for dead-pan humor and Bacon playing a bad guy with much effectiveness. Furthermore, the movie ends on an upbeat note, with the two main characters having resolved the interpersonal issues that had initially strained their relationship. Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds work well together; also, Bridges sings two songs, revealing an excellent singing voice. If one is expecting a sci-fi classic, you will be disappointed. But if one is expecting a well-crafted comedy that will keep you entertained, then you will be gratified."

I get that it's invariably gonna be compared with MiB because they share the same theme, but just because MiB is the superior movie doesn't mean RIPD isn't enjoyable. It has a great cast, good special effects, and an interesting premise. Take it for what it is.... If you go into it looking for a masterpiece, prepare for disappointment. If you just want to be entertained by a pretty good sci-fi movie with some solid laughs, try RIPD out. Just my 2 cents."

Together they had previously collaborated on the classic 'Maniac Cop' series. 'Uncle Sam' is an attempt to recreate the success of that partnership. It may not be as consistent as 'Maniac Cop', but it is a lot of fun, and much more entertaining than most of the b-grade horror mediocrities clogging up the video stores shelves. Lustig and Cohen know their stuff ( the movie is even dedicated to the late Lucio Fulci), and true connoisseurs of trash will eat this one up. A superior b-grade cast, some Lustig and/or Cohen veterans (William Smith, Robert Forster, Frank Pesce), and some who are not -  Bo Hopkins ('The Wild Bunch'), Isaac Hayes ('Escape From New York') and P.J. Soles ('Halloween'), make this one worth the rental. 'Uncle Sam' gets my seal of approval!"

There are some fine character actors, Bo Hopkins plays a scuzzy Army bereavement officer, and Isaac Hayes is a wounded member of Uncle Sam's combat unit, but they are more or less wasted. The script seems like it didn't move much beyond the initial idea, and is badly underdeveloped. If it's a slasher, there is very little tension. If it's a comedy, where are the laughs? For ""black comedy"" to succeed, it must be outrageous, which the film is, but it also cannot be mean spirited, and ""Uncle Sam"" clearly is mean spirited, and somewhat meaningless to boot. Sure, the Uncle Sam on stilts peeper is fun to look at, but a few good scenes cannot save this from being a disappointment. - MERK"

1318,tt0084867,/review/rw2559273/?ref_=tt_urv,"Director William Lustig followed up his classic ""Maniac"" with this equally potent thriller. Robert Forster offers an interesting, low key portrayal of Eddie Marino, a blue collar guy whose wife and son are savagely attacked by loathsome punks. When Eddie realizes that he cannot rely on the ""justice"" system - including a crooked defense attorney (""Maniac"" star Joe Spinell, in an amusing cameo) and an incompetent judge (Vincent Beck), he finally takes a friend, Nick (Fred ""The Hammer"" Williamson), up on his offer to help clean up the streets. The tone is set up very well right away, as The Hammer addresses us all and delivers a monologue bemoaning the level of crime and violence in the modern world. One can indeed see that he and his associates, Ramon (Joseph Carberry) and Burke (Richard Bright), himself a former cop, don't necessarily ENJOY what they do, but see it as being necessary, stressing the basic human right to not have to live in fear. And Lustig and company pull no punches when it comes to the depravity of our antagonists' crimes, not being afraid to cross the line of what might constitute good taste. At the very least, the movie is decent, reasonably gripping entertainment that explores that oft visited theme of what the average person is capable of doing once they've finally been pushed too far. As in ""Maniac"", the use of the various NYC locations is excellent, and there are some great chase sequences and scenes of strong violence. The widescreen photography (it's cool that this movie was shot in the Panavision aspect ratio) is impressive; the haunting and catchy main theme by composer Jay Chattaway may very well stick in the viewer's head a while after the movie has ended. The good supporting cast is also a big help, featuring such performers as Rutanya Alda as Eddie's wife Vickie, Don Blakely as despicable lowlife Prago, salsa music legend Willie Colon as gang leader Rico, Carol Lynley as the ineffective district attorney, the awesome Woody Strode as imposing convict Rake, Frank Pesce as drug dealing scum ""Blueboy"", Peter Savage (to whom the movie is dedicated) as big shot gangster Mr. Stokes, and busy 80's action movie regular Steve James as Patrolman Gibbons.

But in other ways it is a different kind of animal, tougher, more realistic and believable. Directed by William Lustig in between his trash classic 'Maniac' and 'Maniac Cop', the movie greatly benefits from the strong performances of Robert Forster ('Medium Cool', 'Jackie Brown') and Fred Williamson ('Black Caesar'), two actors who unfortunately have generally been wasted in dull action movies and awful straight to video dreck. Forster displays dignity and  depth of character as a working class Joe pushed to his limit, and Fred Williamson gives possibly his most impressive performance ever, as his buddy who shows him a way to get closure. Both Forster and Williamson are supported by an above average cast of character actors including Richard Bright and Joe Spinell (both of 'The Godfather' as well as countless other roles), and veteran Woody Strode.

There is a heckuva car chase near the end that sort of makes up for a dull middle. The movie, which could have just as easily starred Bruce Willis or Mel Gibson in his prime, clearly was aimed at an urban audience even though it was heavily marketed as a mainstream flick. That's why I rented it. It could have been a lot worse, I suppose."

Some scenes are filmed like soap-opera but in general the movie avoids all the clichés from the Hollywood films. I recently saw Miami Vice from Michael Mann and I hated it. For Hollywood there are only good guys and bad guys. Just that, nothing in between. Instead in Shottas shows you exactly how gangsters are created. Created by imitation. Dreaming of a nice life that will never come. Music score is very good and Marley is good even he is not a real pro-actor. Some of the gangsters look like if they were taken from the real shanty-towns of Kingston. That is good. Shows authenticity."
1329,tt0281190,/review/rw0802644/?ref_=tt_urv,"A bit uneven, Shottas suffers from low quality transfers that just add to the film's problems.  My dvd copy would sometimes cut to a black screen that would say: Insert more robbery scenes here.  Technical problems aside: the meaningful dialogue is quite slim- character development seems aimed at an increase in robberies, the direction is lop-sided and meandering, never really wanting to show you much more than hot chicks and nice whips(would have made for a nice extended music video).  While I did like the music, it's over-used and just sort of ""there""- didn't do much for the film other than elicit some head-nodding on my part.  The Anderson character is a joke-he's a political-bad guy cut-out.   And how about that ""tongue-in-cheek"" joke about Wyclef's character banking on a music career? Horrible.  Did I care what happened at the end of the film to the main characters?  Not really, they were bad people who did bad things, a sentiment I held regarding Cess Silvera's directing effort."

Definitely a product of the 80s from Lucci's occasionally too big hair to the synth-heavy soundtrack to the pre-internet boxy computers.

The acronym in the title stands for Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers (as well as something else, revealed in the movie), and that just about tells you everything you need to know. John Heard, a talented actor who never became the star he was tipped to be (just rent 'Cutter's Way' for proof of his potential), plays a photographer who had taken some photos of homeless people who now seem to have disappeared off the face of the Earth. Kin Griest ('Brazil') plays Heard's supportive girlfriend, Daniel Stern ('Diner') an oddball who runs a soup kitchen who has noticed the absence of many of his regulars, and Christopher Curry ('Starship Troopers') a cop investigating a series of mysterious murders. Their investigations all lead in the same direction.... the sewer. The supporting cast also includes small roles from John Goodman ('The Big Lebowski') and quite a few other comic actors, though 'C.H.U.D.' unlike its sequel is not SUPPOSED to be a comedy. No doubt you will get a few unintentional laughs out of it, as it is pretty cheesy, but it's still entertaining enough in a b-grade way. I haven't seen the DVD of this one yet, which I believe has some amusing commentaries by the cast, but as a stand alone movie it's enjoyable trash and worth a rental."
1335,tt0087015,/review/rw0209243/?ref_=tt_urv,"C.H.U.D. is one of those movies that should be bad because its about subterrainian ground-dwellers that are cannibalistic living in a poor area of New York City.  There are no big stars in the film, yet John Heard and Daniel Stern are not nobodies either.  The budget for the film was obviously limited, yet, despite these possible criticisms, I was pleasantly surprised after seeing this film.  This is a wonderful film filled with tension, good acting, a thoughtful script, witty dialogue, and some creatures that certainly looked pretty scary to me.  The basic premise of the film is that homeless folks that live underground have come in contact with radioactive materials which transform them into horrible-looking mutants that go on a rampage and kill men and women for dinner.  The creatures look quite impressive.  This film also throws some social commentary into the mix as well concerning the ever burgeoning homeless problem as well as the storage of harmful wastes.  The acting all around was pretty good with Christopher Curry standing out as a policeman and George Martin as a city official seemingly in charge.  Good Stuff Here!"
1336,tt0087015,/review/rw1302494/?ref_=tt_urv,"""C.H.U.D."" is one of those semi-name oddities that always stood out on video store shelves when I was a youth (lamenting the 'parental lock' on all horror movies I so badly wanted to rent), what with the darkened figures congregating around a manhole, eyes glowing white. Years later, I have finally gotten a chance to see the film, and my response is pretty mixed: it lies somewhere between the Land of Campy and the Dominion of Creepy, with some elements of the Retro Rest Area thrown in for good measure. ""C.H.U.D."" takes a formula familiar to anybody who's seen a '50s 'Big Bug' flick: Evil Guys In Suits are dumping toxic waste where it doesn't belong (in this case, the sewers below Manhattan), thus inspiring some unexpected and unpleasant side effects in the homeless people living under the city--they transform into C.H.U.D.s (Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers), reptilian-looking monsters with a taste for human flesh. While the premise is extremely cheesy, director Douglas Cheek teeters the line between camp and horror rather well--not all-out serious nor a straight romp, it strikes a fair balance (the creepily minimalist, synth-driven score helps, too). The cast of semi-name actors (John Heard, Kim Greist, and a wonderfully wiggy Daniel Stern) treat the material at face value, but never wink at the camera, thus engendering a bizarre charm to the events that transpire. Unfortunately, even for a film that plays as fast and loose as ""C.H.U.D."" does, it leaves a few too many unresolved plot points for my liking. But if you want something a fair distance from the mainstream radar, greased with the grimy spirit of the 1980s, look no further than ""C.H.U.D."""
1337,tt0087015,/review/rw2171055/?ref_=tt_urv,"A movie more well known today for its infamous acronym of a title than anything else, ""C.H.U.D."" (short for Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers...as well as something else) is a shoddily made, dingy affair from 1984 that still manages to somehow entertain. In it, the city of New York has come under attack by these monstrous denizens of the sewer lines and subway system (or is that a redundancy?), the result of the ill-considered dumping of radioactive waste by those bastids at the NRC, and a beleaguered cop (Christopher Curry), a hippy-type soup kitchen owner (Daniel Stern) and a hunky fashion photographer (John Heard) try to get to the, uh, bottom of the escalating nastiness. Befitting its grimy underground milieu and many seedy characters, the film has a dark, dirty feel but is still fun to watch; ""C.H.U.D.""'s no dud, but it sure piles on the crud! The film would surely have benefited from a larger budget--its glowing-orbed monsters look pretty ridiculous when seen clearly--but still features decent-enough acting, an effectively somber synth score by Cooper Hughes, an explosive shower scene, John Goodman and Jay Thomas (of all people!) as a pair of goofy cops, and some mildly effective gross-outs. As far as monster movies go, it is nothing special, but still fun enough, and deserving of much more than the ""Bomb"" rating that the drips at Maltinville have given it. And really, how can you dislike any film that manages to quote from both the Grateful Dead's ""Uncle John's Band"" AND Talking Heads' ""Life During Wartime""? The picture is well presented on this Anchor Bay DVD, and includes some interesting extras as well. As revealed in the book ""DVD Delirium,"" not to be missed is the hidden ""Easter egg"" extra, located by clicking on the C.H.U.D.'s eyes in the main menu. Fans of the film's female star, Kim Greist, should certainly appreciate this one! And oh...I love the appropriate name of the actor who plays the film's coroner: Henry Yuk!"

Who the culprit is won't be a huge shock to you but how they are doing it is pretty cool. The main selling point of this film is the terrific cast, even though some of the bigger names have small roles. Despite being top billed, Bela Lugosi plays a minor part as a butler. Lionel Atwill also has a minor role as a doctor. Leif Erickson plays a lusty chauffeur and Nils Asther a Hindu mystic. Janet Shaw has a memorable part early on as a sassy maid who can't get away from the Ingston estate fast enough. But the best parts go to Ralph Morgan and Fay Helm as the deranged brother and sister. This is a great movie to pass an hour. Universal made it and it's usually billed as a horror film. It does have some supernatural overtones but at its heart it's basically a murder mystery. A good one, though."
1347,tt0035124,/review/rw2413013/?ref_=tt_urv,"1942's NIGHT MONSTER was a staple of Universal's SHOCK! package of classic horrors issued to television in the late 50s, showing up 6 times on Pittsburgh's Chiller Theater from 1966 to 1983. This was the only Universal to grant Bela Lugosi top billing since the 1931 Dracula, with even 1932's MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE listing him below not-so-virginal ingénue Sidney Fox (a triumph for the casting couch!). For the record, other servant/butler roles Lugosi played can be found in 1933's NIGHT OF TERROR, 1939's THE GORILLA, 1944's ONE BODY TOO MANY, 1945's THE BODY SNATCHER, 1946's GENIUS AT WORK, and 1956's THE BLACK SLEEP. His Rolf has little to do, but he was still a regular participant in the studio's horrors, and always a welcome presence. 'A scream in the night through the fog on Pollard Slough,' hiding something so hideously terrifying that even the frogs stop croaking whenever its shadow passes by (if that doesn't set the proper mood, nothing will!). The opening credits are presented in front of the same forest set built for THE WOLF MAN, featuring music identical to the credits for THE GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN. Second billed Lionel Atwill also plays a small role, but it's the one doctor he's best suited for, getting good scene stealing mileage out of his exasperated reactions to Francis Pierlot's gland obsessed fellow physician. Kudos to beloved character actor Frank Reicher, best remembered for KING KONG, whose sensitive realistic portrayal of Dr. Timmons is vastly different from the bombastic Atwill. Tending the wealthy and powerful Kurt Ingston in his time of illness, the three have left him 'a helpless cripple, a misshapen thing that must hide even from the servants in the house.' Ralph Morgan is in top form as the wheelchair bound owner of Ingston Towers, with hilarious support from Leif Erickson as the lecherous chauffeur Laurie, even daring to flirt with Doris Lloyd's icy housekeeper, whom he refers to as 'old frozen face.' Little used actress Janet Shaw enjoys one of her few major roles, as Millie Carson, the suspicious maid who abruptly quits without notice, but makes the fatal mistake of returning for her belongings after nightfall, becoming the first on screen victim of the prowling horror, to the eerie silence of the fog shrouded darkness. Director Alfred Hitchcock was preparing SHADOW OF A DOUBT at Universal that summer, and screened this picture because he wanted to cast Janet as a burned out waitress in his film ('I'd just die for a ring like that'). Hitchcock was duly impressed by what he saw in NIGHT MONSTER, and was amazed that it was shot with great style and pace in just 11 days by producer-director Ford Beebe, who had just graduated from serial work. Despite the disappointment for some Lugosi buffs, this fan has long championed its qualities to remain genuinely frightening even today, receiving its long awaited due as a Universal horror classic, a real ensemble piece where the entire cast stands out, a genuine chiller that featured prominently on Chiller Theater, perfect viewing in the dark at 2:00 in the morning."

Film firsts should be noted and applauded even if the films they appear in are otherwise unremarkable. TERROR FROM THE YEAR 5000 is a somewhat lackluster production with uneven performances and direction. I say that this film is shade a better than most other low budget quickies from 1958 in that its story slightly more imaginative. The time machine was something new to films in 1958, the bit with the hypnotic finger nails is certainly unusual and don't forget the four eyed mutant cat from the future. I thought the idea of having the future women at first mistakenly speaking Greek was a clever idea, since the present people had sent the future people with trinkets that had Greek writing on them. The make up for the future woman is quite poor, no wonder the director mostly kept her face hidden throughout. There is one scene where the scientists leave the island and go to a movie on the mainland. AIP studio heads must of come up with this scene to insert a little promotion.

No, the film isn't as good(or political)as the two sequels, but it does say something about the isolation of the individual in a society that won't stand up and protect that individual from harm. There's a profound sense of solitude in the cinematography of beaches and seaside highways and the sparse, often inarticulate dialog. And, looking closely at the motorcycle gang, you can see some none-too-subtle homosexual overtones.

It's the most entertaining of the ""biker movie"" genre, because it has a story and vivid characters. Elizabeth James is Vicky Barrington, a vacationing college student who comes up against a nasty motorcycle gang in a California mountain town. Naturally, the gang, headed by a weathered Jeremy Slate, take off after Vicky (who is on a motorcycle wearing white boots and a matching bikini) and two of them eventually catch and rape her. She's not the only victim. Three incredibly foolish local girls visit the gang's ""clubhouse"" and meet a similar fate. But they don't have a champion like Tom Laughlin (in his first appearance as Billy Jack) who manages to get Vicky out of danger (at least for a while) and subsequently falls in love with her. ""Born Losers"" has a great score by ""Wild Angels"" composer (and future Lieutenant Governor of California) Mike Curb, good acting by a large cast, and a fine cameo appearance by Jane Russell as the trashy mother of one of the victimized girls. Add some beautiful locations and some slick motorcycle stunts, and you have a ""Born Winner!""

The strange but tasty Elizabeth James, who also wrote the crazy script, plays a buxom free spirit on two wheels who tangles with the bikers and comes off second best. Billy forms a close friendship with her and becomes instrumental in her life by breaking heads and defending her lost honor. The screenplay is no masterpiece and there are dozens of plot holes, but this fine piece of savage 70's exploitation succeeds by sheer balls.

Some scenes, such as the auto auction in the run down lot, or the Radio DJ's cramped little studio add to some crisp atmosphere.  However, the first half of GI60S is rather amateurish (One entire scene is terribly out of focus) and we have trouble following Halicki's unprofessionally written plot.  The second half of the film is a car chase that has to be seen to be believed! In 40 minutes, close to 90 cars are destroyed in  a massive auto chase spanning several cities, freeways, parks, lots, you just name it.

Fortunately Night of the Executioner delivers on all three of these elements with enough aplomb to override my natural dislike of the simplistic, morally vacant set up. The plot is as simple as can be, Dr. Hugo Arranz is celebrating his 50th birthday with his wife and daughter, when vile hoodlums break in, rape and kill both wife and daughter and cut off his tongue in fairly graphic fashion. Fortunately he survives and unsurprisingly goes all Bronson on their punk asses, after some training with knives, guns and weights. And this is how the rest of the film goes, there are a few breaks for musing on the failure of justice, the faults of liberal ideas and the destabilising effects of trauma, but the sociological context is hardly explored, it is there more as a counterweight to the violence a means of breaking the tension, alleviating the slightly one note nature of the film. Director/star Paul Naschy (Jacinto Molina) proves a dab hand with the material, though showing his age his past as a weightlifter enables him to pull off some impressive lifting during the training sequence, and while he takes a comically short time to become a sharp shooting, knife throwing master, he wears a face of such grim determination that his character becomes believable. Its a fine performance in a stony sort of way, he does little more than occasionally nod his head or shift an eyebrow but is never dull, he radiates a cold, unfeeling menace, stark urge for vengeance that really fits the material. The rest of the performances are generally fair as well, though since I can't find a cast list that actually matches actors to characters (this being quite a rare one) I won't go too much into details. The lead villain, Ralph, is a particularly effective scumbag, so props to whoever played him, and the women tend toward the rather beautiful, which is another definite plus. The action gets a bit repetitive as is perhaps inevitable and the film could have done with a little more ambition in its violence, knives and guns may be an efficient way of taking out the enemy but they aren't the most interesting of methods. Still, some bloody squibs and a decent body count keep things fun and the film isn't afraid of letting its baddies get down to some real mean behaviour. The opening violation is particularly good, sleaziness worthy of the 70's even if it isn't quite as excessive as some of that glorious decade. Later in the film this opening is revisited to god effect as well, jagged cuts to choice frozen highlights of his wife and daughters demise driving Dr Arranz to frenzy In fact the film in general looks as if it was made in the late 70's, the only thing that really connects it to its actual time of release is a number of cheeky references to Hollywood action, including one to Charles Bronson. Its a nice touch, as if Naschy is purposefully positioning his film over American ones as the definitive mindless action thriller. Definitive it ain't but the film is still a lot of fun, with even a few cheesy moments to raise chuckles it has a whole package, mean violence, nudity, rape, some fun bloodshed and some unintended laughs, its all there! Not a film likely to appeal to anyone outside of violent action trash and vengeance lovers, but to those its a rarity worth seeking out. Happy hunting!"

In a sense it sort of comes across as being his typical dark and gritty film yet in another sense it is also very much an heroic fantasy. In a way it is a shame that the film flopped the way it did because it was actually a pretty enjoyable film, and I certainly quite like Ritchie's style of directing. Okay, a part of me didn't quite get the humour of the piece, particularly since we had a similar style in all of his films. However, what we do need to remember is the Ritchies style has always been very gritty, and King Arthur is no exception."

While partying in the village, they are lured and offered in an international auction to sadistic members of the Elite Hunting under a contract that does not allow leaving the torture chamber in a hidden facility alive."
1418,tt0498353,/review/rw1669490/?ref_=tt_urv,"Eli Roth has learnt a lot of things from his mate Quentin Tarantino, but without a shadow of a doubt, how to talk was the one he learnt best. If you believed everything that came out of the Hostel: Part 2 director's mouth, you'd be under the impression that this was a new lesson in extreme cinema, pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable on screen to new and previously unheard of levels. Gore-hounds though will most likely walk out the multiplexes with the same aftertaste that the first Hostel left; it's violent sure, but it's not the harshest, most disturbing film ever made by a long shot. In fact, the only reason you should approach with kid gloves is because this time, it is girls that suffer. Young, nice and pretty girls with much to offer the world and whether or not dismembering them is more shocking than torturing and killing a horny male jock is a matter for feminist academics to debate."

I know there are not that many fans to the first film, I understand somewhat, it's not for the faint of heart and the first half is like a soft core porno, not to mention the blood and gore that's involved. But I think somewhere down the line it will be a classic cult film. Now for the sequel, I thought, despite a few flaws here and there, I thought it was just as good, maybe even BETTER than the first.

1421,tt0469965,/review/rw1429387/?ref_=tt_urv,"The original Road House is by no means an award winning film. But it is one of the great guilty pleasures of all time. It shouldn't have been that hard to make a sequel. There's no need for a big budget, big name stars, and spectacular visual effects. Even the story didn't have to be original. All it needed was a good time vibe, and some great fist fights. I don't mean Matrix-style ""wire-fu"", just some well choreographed barroom brawls. Lots of them. There are a couple of decent fights in the movie, but none of them are memorable, and the focus is more on gun play. Plus, the way it ties in to the original film is laughable, bordering on insulting. Johnathon Schaech plays Shane Tanner, an undercover DEA agent who is good with his hands and feet. But here's the kicker...he's the son of Patrick Swayze's character Dalton!!!! Say what????? Let's see, the original Road House was made in 1989. So for Dalton to have a son in his late 20's (maybe even 30) in 2006...well you get the idea. They give it a cheesy explanation that he lived with his uncle Nate (Will Patton) while his father ""travelled around a lot"". Oh please. That itself almost warranted shutting this movie off. But I digress. Schaech is completely out of his element. Sure he can throw a couple of kicks, but he's got nothing going on as an actor. Plus, he's referred to in the movie by the bad guys as ""pretty boy"". I've never scrutinized men that closely, but I don't think this guy is too good looking. He looks sick. His face is way too thin, and his sunken eyes make it look like he's going to pass out at any moment. I'd never heard of him before, but I think he should give up acting and go back to his day job. Jake Busey plays the local drug runner Wild Bill. Busey is not a terrible actor. He was good in Starship Troopers, and even made a menacing villain in Hitcher 2. But here, he just chews the scenery in standard bad guy mode. Even his ""threating"" dialog is yawn worthy. We're supposed to buy him as the man that has the whole town in his pocket. But why? What does he do? Because he wants to buy a bar from Patton ""by any means necessary""? Ellen Hollman has the token girlfriend role. A woman with a secret. Too bad that secret is about as difficult to figure out as 2+2. She's the local elementary school teacher who happens to be a former Army soldier. Guess what that means? It means that while she may quiver with fear for the majority of the movie, she'll be ready to smash heads when the fur starts to fly. Oh well, at least she's hot. Actually the fight between her and Wild Bill's girl is the best one in the movie. It's fast, brutal, and entertaining. Which leads me to my next problem with the movie...the fights. As I said Schaech knows how to throw a punch. The same can't be said for anyone he faces in the movie. Obviously the movie will all come down to Schaech versus Busey. Busey is an actor, not a fighter. He doesn't possess the skills to pull of a movie fight. Swayze may have been a trained dancer, but his athletic ability gave him the means to pull off well choreographed fights. He also faced a couple of worthy opponents, and had one killer (literally) move. None of that here. With a couple of exceptions, the fights are forced, poorly staged, and routine. The punches sound like someone smacking a 2X4 on the concrete, and there's even a couple of parts where the sound doesn't even match up to the punch. It's embarrassing. There isn't even the good southern/redneck music of the original. Road House had the Jeff Healy Band, who were a somewhat popular band at the time. This movie features a singer called John Otto, whose music is tepid, and his acting even worse. He's given one line in the movie, which was probably inserted to appease whatever fans he may have out there. Either that, or someone owed him a favor. My final complaint about the movie is one that comes out of just being picky...the continuity. Movies are shot out of sequence, and then it's the editor's job to piece it all together. Well someone should give the editor of this movie a little shove. The problems range from little things like people not looking the same direction when a shot changes, to RE-USED footage at the end of the movie. In the beginning, we are introduced to the bar, The Black Pellican. As the camera moves through the bar, you see the band, the bouncers, and the people dancing. At the end of the movie, when the bad guys have been defeated, we get another shot of the same bar, with insert shots of our hero sitting at the bar with his girl. The problem is, the footage of the people in the bar is the SAME footage from the beginning of the movie!!! I kid you not. It's the same people, standing (or dancing) in the same places, wearing the same clothes. Want to know the funniest part? You see bouncers in the shot that were KILLED earlier in the movie. Do yourself a favor, don't watch this movie unless YOU feel the need to go out and punch someone. This movie will make you angry enough to do it."
1422,tt0469965,/review/rw1461892/?ref_=tt_urv,"""Direct-to-video"" is a phrase that never sounds promising to the consumer unless its a direct-to-video sequel to something that went direct-to-video in the first place. Despite this, studios have insisted on releasing numerous direct-to-video sequels over the years to cult hits. I don't think it even needs to be mentioned that these sequels rank among some of the worst titles of all time, including THE HITCHER II, STARSHIP TROOPERS 2, and CRUEL INTENTIONS 3. It's fitting that ROAD HOUSE 2 was helmed by Scott Ziehl as he was also the man in charge of ruining the Cruel Intentions series. Like his entry in the Cruel Intentions trilogy, Ziehl takes elements that made the first ROAD HOUSE a great guy flick, and rehashes them with no success whatsoever. This is no sequel, this is a remake all the way. Various lines from the original are repeated, plot points cut and pasted, and scenes are replicated almost shot-for-shot from the first one. The one thing that could not be duplicated were the amazing fight scenes, which made ROAD HOUSE what it was. Here, we get clumsily directed fight sequences that are either too short or too long and seemingly planned out and shot within an hour. Compare that with its predecessor's fight scenes that look like they took months and months to prepare. Ziehl is capable of directing action as he did well with the 2001 remake of EARTH VS. THE SPIDER, but none of the talent shown there comes through in this mess. It's not completely his fault, as the screenplay is very, very poorly written and clunky. I don't care if something goes direct-to-video, a good script is still required. Someone should keep that mind while continuously churning these low-budget, direct-to-DVD movies out. Skip it entirely. 1/10"
1423,tt0469965,/review/rw1426223/?ref_=tt_urv,"Let me start by saying you know a film is poorly run when extras make the cover. With that said, anyone who says this is the worst film ever is being dramatic, and anyone who says that the film is great is completely delusional. The film ""is what it is."" And what is that... A modest budget ($4 million, I estimate) studio sequel. The film isn't terrible, but for Road House fans it will be a disappointment. And that brings me to problem one, just as Dirty Dancing wouldn't been what it was without Swayze, Road House isn't the same without him. The lead lacks depth, character, and likability to carry the film. I feel that the lead was poorly cast and the producers should have bent over backwards to get Patrick to do it if they were gonna do a sequel. The other cast was uneven with outstanding actors like Will Patton along side day players who couldn't act there way out of a paper bag. Busey, who I have seen do great characters seemed like he just mailed it in. Ellen was played well, except for not being believable at all as a bayou raised chick. Sherri, the DEA agent at the first bar was hot and a good actress, yet her part was awkwardly small and undeveloped. The writer totally missed all opportunities to add depth and interest to the story and characters. Instead opting for a base one dimensional film. Which leads me to the biggest problem, the script... I got a bad feeling when the credits rolled and there were three script writers separated by an ""and"" and an ""&."" It looked very amateur. And that is what the writing was. I heard the original script was better and then a rewrite was done and the hard core sucking began. Some cheezy parts of the film to watch for are... During the first undercover meeting, the obvious drug deal under the table. ""Hey lets meet at a crowded nudey bar, I will pull a block of coke out of my jacket and you pull cash out then we will slide them under the cocktail table"" WAIT! ""Make sure to look cool when you look left and right to make sure no one is looking!"" Second, I love it when someone gets shot in the chest and then you see him sitting up happy as a lark 10 minutes later. There are some nasty editing cuts towards the end of the film especially during fight scenes and when the main character is chasing thru doors and runs into a patron. Which brings me to the realism of the DEA training, I won't both to get technical... But jumping thru doors isn't standard training... Nor do typical female agents, who bust their butts to make it in a male oriented field, act like weak characters... Boring! Thanks for the chauvinistic view Heir Director. There is other stuff I could teach a course at a school about it... The sped up fighting, the cheezy dialogue, the recycled story... etc... But aside from all that you just cannot like ex-Mr. Applegate, he totally lacks the humble zen coolness that made Mr. Patrick Swayze such a bad ass. He just strikes me as one of those 5 foot nothing actors who think they are a bad ass, but just like Van Damnit he runs into a real bad ass (Chuck Zito in Van Don't case) and he gives him a lesson about ""badassdom."" Therefore, that I feel is the major linchpin of the film, if you are a bad ass you are a bad ass, you don't have to try. Example: Swayze! If you are a pretty boy who tries to hard to prove you are a bad ass among other things... Then well... You are why your audience, the Average Joe... Will not rent this film, and if they do they will write reviews like this."
1424,tt0469965,/review/rw1769819/?ref_=tt_urv,"The original ""Roadhouse"" ranked as an invigorating, hard-knuckled, bruiser of a B-picture that benefited tremendously from good performances by Patrick Swayze, Ben Gazzara, and Sam Elliot, along with several tough-as-nails fights, and red-hot babe chicks with bosomy charms. Of course, the in-name sequel only ""Roadhouse 2: Last Call"" emerges as just another cash-in quickly follow-up film that has little to do with the original, but it isn't as tame or lame as the usual straight-to-video sequel. In other words, ""Roadhouse 2"" ain't half-bad, even if it is strictly formula without anything substantial to set it apart from the hundreds of other knuckle-busting, testosterone thrillers."

There's plenty of clown creepiness going on here and its reasonably well done. There's also a fair bit of gore. However it is let down by a poor script and unconvincing characters, including Kane.

Whatever happened to the great tradition of low budget barbarian films? Today you see try hard films with reasonable cgi effects but shockingly bad performances, and scripts that are usually anachronistic and too self aware (blame TV's Hercules and Xena for this?). The problem I think is the filmmakers of today take themselves too seriously. Make a low budget film and be proud of it, 'Ator' is not impressive on any technical front but it is sure as hell entertaining. This film isn't trying to be 'Conan' any more than a daytime TV soap is trying to be serious drama. it is what it is, if you can't deal with that then don't watch coz you just won't get it.

The rating applies to the entertainment value, which is fairly substantial, unintended laughs and all. Beefy Miles O'Keeffe, then riding high after making an impression in ""Tarzan, the Ape Man"", plays the title character, a warrior who, it has been prophesied, will rise up and vanquish an evil ruler, the High Priest of the Spider, played by Dakar, whom you'll recognize from ""Zombi 2"" and ""Dr. Butcher, M.D."" The priests' henchmen have snatched Ator's luscious would be bride Sunya (Ritza Brown), whom he was led to believe is his sister (!). Fortunately, as he goes on a quest where he's never ever challenged to a great degree, he acquires an equally delectable travelling companion, Roon (Sabrina Siani), who's only interested in treasure seeking. From the predictably tacky special effects (we can clearly see the wires manipulating the legs of the giant spider at the end) to the skimpy costumes on the ladies to that hilariously ridiculous end credits song on the American print, ""Ator l'invincibile"" (or ""Ator the Fighting Eagle"" as it's known in the U.S.) is agreeable if not outstanding genre entertainment. It's obviously more for the kiddies than the older viewers; one can hardly fail to notice that it's really rather tame, which is especially surprising considering the other, very adult titles on director Joe D'Amato's resume. There's even a little shameless button pushing in giving Ator a constant animal companion in the form of an adorable bear cub. However, even though this is therefore not going to appeal to some people, it's still hard not to like, as it stumbles its way through its 93 minute running time. O'Keefe and Siani may not be the most expressive actors in the business, but when they look the way they do, it's hard to imagine too many people complaining. Adding to the fun are the appearances of other familiar faces from exploitation cinema: Edmund Purdom (""Pieces"") as Griba, who gives Ator all important advice and training, and the ever stunning Laura Gemser as Indun, the temptress (annoyingly, this character is never properly paid off). They all make this easy enough to watch, even though this is also easy enough to forget. Followed by three sequels, with O'Keeffe returning for two of them. Six out of 10."

A bemused Miles O'keeffe plays the title character and goes about things in a rather laborious manner (uneventful journey with plenty of strutting and flat sword choreography) although there are some amusingly terrible dialogue exchanges (the heart to heart talk about love with romantic interludes), a lousy twist and a battle scene with a slow moving gigantic spider but other than that not much to recommend.

1458,tt0061189,/review/rw1235116/?ref_=tt_urv,"Roger Corman's modestly-budgeted ""wheeler"" for American International Pictures opens brilliantly, with the evocative cinematography from Richard Moore promising more than what Corman, screenwriter Charles Griffith, or the cast can eventually deliver. Plot has Southern California biker gang enjoying rumbles, cycle jousts, hassling the Mexicans, and outrunning the local heat; but when Bruce Dern steals a police-bike and gets shot, gang ""president"" Peter Fonda hatches a plan to break him out of the hospital and thus keep him out of prison. The film looks terrific from start to finish, but the line-readings are sometimes so painful and awkward, one wishes Corman could cut back on the dialogue and just allow the visuals to tell the story. Sort of the older brother to ""Easy Rider"", ""Angels"" was eclipsed in popularity and relevance just a few years later. Supporting cast includes Diane Ladd, Gayle Hunnicutt, Michael J. Pollard, and Nancy Sinatra, whose hospital crying scene is a hoot. *1/2 from ****"
1459,tt0061189,/review/rw2631732/?ref_=tt_urv,"That's what it seemed like ''way back in 1966. Producer Roger Corman set out to make a film based on the notorious California-Based ''Hell's Angels'' motorcycle gang, having seen a cover story about them in Life Magazine.Legendary ''B'' movie studio, American International Pictures was just as anxious to jump on the ''Biker Bandwagon'' (they eventually produced or distributed eleven more films on this subject) and gave the OK to Corman. Though George Chakiris (''West Side Story'' Oscar Winner) was originally cast in the lead role, it was Peter Fonda who ended up playing the part. Playing his ''Old Lady'' was Nancy Sinatra, who was then riding high with her hit single ''These Boots Are Made For Walkin'.Bruce Dern played ''The Loser'' the part originally intended for Fonda, and Dern's then wife Diane Ladd portrayed his on-screen spouse. There were a few familiar faces among the supporting actors as well, including Gayle Hunnicutt, in an early appearance, and Assistant Director Peter Bogdonavich, who is glimpsed in the climactic brawl,as is Corman himself. The story itself is really just a loosely connected series of incidents which allow the viewer to follow the ''Angel's'' exploits as if they were viewing a Documentary about the gang. Since ''The Wild One''aside, this was the film that started the whole ''Cycle'' cycle, it's not surprising that it has a very experimental feel to it.The location photography is excellent, and belies the brief three week shooting schedule, while the musical score written by future AIP Biker music stalwart (and future Lieutenant Governor) Mike Curb, is dynamic and fits the visuals like a glove. The same goes for the group (''Davie Allan And The Arrows'') who perform it. In fact ''Blues Theme'' was a hit single for the group, and the Soundtrack Album proved so popular that a second volume was released. Both records, in fact, started the ''Motorcycle Soundtrack'' craze, most of which were released on Curb's ''Tower/Sidewalk'' labels, a Capitol Records affiliate during the 60's. The actors themselves are not given much opportunity to spread their wings and fly, so to speak, but, under the circumstances, they do all right. Dern is especially convincing as ''The Loser'' and Ladd evokes the sympathy her character calls for. Fonda is a bit weak as ''Heavenly Blues'' the leader, but Sinatra makes a pretty tough ''Momma'' and though her natural beauty is downplayed, she is still very easy on the eyes.Upon it's release, the low-budget film proved enormously popular (AIP'S biggest hit so far) and convinced them to launch a whole series of ''Protest'' films. (A wise decision on their part, because they kept the studio in the profit margin for years to come). The Biker genre would have it's share of hits and misses, and, thanks to a few Poverty-Row, independent productions like ''The Hellcats'' ''The Rebel Rousers'' and ''The Cycle Savages'' (starring Dern) all of which made this one seem fairly lavish by comparison, it had petered out by the early seventies. Nevertheless, ''The Wild Angels'' and a few successors like ''Devil's Angels'' and ''Born Losers'' (both released in 1967) remain among the most popular''B'' films of their era."

I love the first two films because they are both scary and well made, but WOW, this film is GARBAGE. TRUST ME, this is coming from a HUGE JC fan! The film takes place between the 1st and 2nd movie, which is dumb because nobody wanted to see what happened between the 1st and 2nd movie. I wanted to see what happened after the 2nd movie, but even then, it's really confusing because the plot keeps jumping back and forth between all of these dumb characters. I couldn't tell if the film was set in the present day, in 2001, or in the 70's because of the craptastic pacing. There's even a scene where you can see a 2016 Chevy truck in a film that supposedly takes place in 2001. Speaking of pacing, there is none! Nothing happens in this movie and the film ends right when it should've started! There are so many characters that the film gets lost in itself. The first film had Darry and Trish, simple and easy. The 2nd film had the athletes and a side-plot revolving around an angry father, but it was still easy to follow and well balanced. Here, we have an old lady getting visions from her dead son, then we have Sargeant Tubbs from the first movie, then we have the anti-Creeper gang, then we have some teenagers, then we have a country boy who has a crush on a girl, and said girl also gets her own storyline. All the characters are pointless and are not flushed out because the film is trying so hard to give equal focus to everyone. The CGI is SO BAD and is EVERYWHERE in the film. It's so bad that my theater was laughing louder than the actual movie! The Creeper doesn't do ANYTHING, no smelling fear, eating body parts, he just sorta walks around and grunts. There's one good scene where a group of teenage bikers finds The Creepers truck in the woods, and it's the only good scene in the entire film. That's it! Worst of all, WE STILL DON'T KNOW THE CREEPERS'S ORIGINS!!! I've been waiting nearly 2 decades and we STILL DON'T KNOW WHERE HE COMES FROM??? The film ends on a cliffhanger but I do not want a 4th movie. This feels like it should've been made for the SyFy channel and seeing this on the big screen is like seeing Lake Placid 6 on the big screen. Just don't do it!"

Production wasn't delayed, it was 14 years of cinematic constipation, but unfortunately, they finally crapped out a pitiful, useless end to the Jeepers Creepers saga. Ironically, the budget was probably less than a roll of toilet paper. Also, for the record, I am a die-hard fan of the first two films and I promise you I went into part 3 determined to like it, despite the garbage trailers and negative online buzz that was surrounding it. Bottom-line, the first film is scary, the second is fun, and the third is cancer. The creeper did not age well. Someone behind the camera has clearly lost their touch because this one just felt like a cheap, direct-to-video cash grab made without love or legitimate purpose.

I have seen some fan-based horror makeup videos on Youtube and Facebook made by teenagers that come very close to the makeup work done in major Hollywood films so I felt there isn't any excuse for the poor work made on this film today. The acting wasn't very good with the exception of Owen Conway who plays the husband. Conway did a pretty good job considering the script doesn't have rich dialog. The film is yet another possession film that gets the whole catholic rituals wrong. But the story does have an interesting twist on the possession genre that I'm surprised other filmmakers haven't explored. What might happen if the possessed happens to be pregnant? and what about the child born from that woman? But the film does drag on in the beginning so the pace doesn't pick up until halfway through the film.

Ultra cheap with plenty of action/violence and enough funny gore to satisfy any fan of 80s b-rated sleaze. Not to mention a ridiculous soundtrack! The only thing that's missing is some boobies. Not that there's no sex just not anything arousing in any way. Of course it takes place in the post apocalyptic future where a gang of ridiculously costumed barbarian types called the Templars set out to destroy the few humans left as punishment for the crime of being born.

I could be wrong and an Italian man could have gleaned a lot of work building cardboard cities for all those 80's Italian post-apocalypse films. Regardless, the opening credits let us know the world came to an end due to a meteor or some stagehand's forgotten cigarette crashing into a cardboard city. After this we have to deal with another of Max Rockatansky's cousins that suffers a few mental setbacks. Scorpion drives around in his mock up V-8 Interceptor with a big glowing bubble dome in the roof, superfluous tubes, and hood mounted chrome skull. Scorpion's enemies are a smorgasbord of peeved caddies that roll across the wasteland in their super-modified golf carts complete with slicers, dicers, disintegrators, spears, donkey molesters, and other implements of golfing terror and destruction. The terrified victims of these rampaging carts are hard pressed not to completely outrun these lumbering carts of woe and despair. Laden as they are with donkey molesters, flame throwers, tin foil, and extra passengers these vehicles of the brave new wasteland top out and redline around 2 MPH. Apparently all the survivors of the wasteland made fun of the golf carts because One (George Eastman), the leader of the post-apocalyptic rugged caddies that call themselves the Templars wants to kill everybody in the wasteland. Scorpion (Giancarlo Prete) being the yin to One's yang only wants to kill a select few people, mostly ones that ride around on golf carts causing trouble. One (Eastman) establishes himself as the true entity of evil early on by effortlessly ripping (or rather breaking) a bible in half in a rather comical display of strength. Giovanni Frezza makes an appearance as the young mechanic and you may very well recognize him from Bava's Demons 2 or Fulci's House by the Cemetery. Giovanni gives another stellar performance as he freely transforms from his diminutive figure to a strapping, full-grown stuntman in a blond wig when convenient."

But as usual with medium to low budget movies that have not been messed around with by a studio looking to reap a profit there is more to this than may first meet the eye. The film's plot concerns itself with a group of genuinely unlikeable morons who move into a house formerly owned by a descendant of ""Toltec and Aztec"" shamans that is on the site of a former burial ground, or repository of ancient Native American artifacts. Offense is given to the tribal gods when one of the losers turns out to be a scab who leaves the seat up when taking a leak, invites his pathetic friends over for a beer party, and his snot rag sister starts giving the black chick in the movie racist trash.

This ancient Latin American tribe, even preceding the Aztecs, supposedly had the most malevolent and bloodthirsty sorcerers, yet they get their asses whooped by a couple of college floozies and a one-hundred-and-seven-year old lawman with a whip! But before you get to see this, however, you have to struggle through more than 40 minutes of sheer boredom, infantile pranks and sleazy sequences that don't contain any actual sleaze. In case I haven't made myself entirely clear yet: ""The Dark Power"" is an indescribably cheesy and inept piece of 80's horror crap that still manages to be amusing because of its sheer and somewhat charming stupidity factor. Writer/director Phil Smoot's intentions were obviously admirable, but he – as well as the rest of the cast & crew – lacked the talent and financial means to deliver something even half-decent. Smoot carefully watched ""The Evil Dead"" and other similar demonic-themed movies, and somehow must have thought he could pull this off as well. The movie opens with an old Indian guy dying in his isolated countryside house; barely speaking out his last word above a whisper  Toltecs. His grandson promptly rents out house to a bunch of college chicks, including a typically 80's aerobics babe, a cute black girl and a racist redneck gal. Soon they will discover why exactly the old Indian lived like a hermit, as he was actually the guardian of an ancient Toltec burial ground. Toltec sorcerers buried themselves alive, only to emerge again thousands of years later and feed on the flesh of the living. And, honestly, is there any better tasting flesh than that of bimbos? As hinted at before already, the first half of ""The Dark Power"" is terribly lame and sleep-inducing. The clichéd pranks, the retarded dialogs and the ridiculously overlong footage of Lash LaRue swinging around his whip seem to go on forever. Then, the movie loses its last smidgen of credibility when the Toltec sorcerers emerge from the ground. Instead of menacing, they look like drugged out hard rock stars with imbecile masks and drunken gestures. Exactly ONE gory moment is worth mentioning, when a guy's lips are stretched out over his entire skull, but overall even the carnage aspect of this movie is disappointing. The only remotely worthwhile moments are utterly senseless, like when a 9-year-old kid (named Cletus!) goes joyriding with his uncle's truck or when the vulgar naked chick sips beer in the bathtub after working out. Seriously, unless you get turned on by the sight of a 1940's western veteran swinging around his whip at nothing, I'd advise to skip this film."

Russo (an associate of George A. Romero who'd co-written the classic ""Night of the Living Dead""), who adapted his own novel.

Is it trying to prey on every parent's fear that their lovable moppets will turn into radioactive zombies? Is it trying to make an environmental statement about how nuclear waste will turn children's fingernails black and make them kill every adult they touch? Is it trying to impress the gorehounds with its incredible special effects (i.e. dry ice and black fingernail polish)?

Apparently this concept isn't so new or innovating at all, as the obscure (although less obscure now, with its recent release on DVD) and still criminally underrated 70's gem ""Chosen Survivors"" thrives on a similar premise. Only this movie is at least a gazillion times better than any Big Brother edition you ever saw, because it has genuine suspense, a formidable cast of characters, plot twists you actually don't see coming and – not to forget – thousands of bloodthirsty bats! Now, THAT is what they should do in the TV-series of Big Brother: unleash an army of aggressive and rabid bats on the attention-horny participants, ha! Ayway, ""Chosen Survivors"" opens with atmospheric images of the New Mexican desert and army helicopters approaching a secret underground lair. Eleven eminent persons, who achieved great things is different fields (sports, science, literature, business) awake to hear they are the chosen survivors. On the earth's surface, a nuclear war has wiped out all humanity and they are to remain underground until it is safe again to re-populate the planet. But of course, the survivors don't get along as they should, some them behave overly hostile and suspicious and the hi-tech government designed lair isn't exactly bat-proof. The film offers a splendid combination of terrific character drawing, for psychological tension, and actual nail-bitingly tense situation with the bat attacks and the quest for freedom. H.B. Cross' script is excellent and Sutton Roley, usually a director of TV series episodes, does an amazing job providing the film with a genuine apocalyptic feeling.

1535,tt0368226,/review/rw0924689/?ref_=tt_urv,"I have now seen Mr. Tommy Wiseau's cinematic tour-de-force, 'The Room'  three times. With each viewing, 'The Room' becomes more complexly  entangled in and inseparable from my own life. I no longer know where  The Room ends and I begin.  It is, without question, the worst film ever made. But this comment is in no way meant to be discouraging.  Because while The Room is the worst movie ever made it is also the  greatest way to spend a blisteringly fast 100 minutes in the dark.  Simply put, 'The Room' will change your life.  It's not just the dreadful acting or the sub-normal screenplay or the  bewildering direction or the musical score so soaked in melodrama that  you will throw up on yourself or the lunatic-making cinematography; no,  there is something so magically wrong with this movie that it can only  be the product of divine intervention. If you took the greatest  filmmakers in history and gave them all the task of purposefully  creating a film as spectacularly horrible as this not one of them, with  all their knowledge and skill, could make anything that could even be  considered as a contender. Not one line or scene would rival any moment  in The Room.  The centerpiece of this filmic holocaust is Mr. Tommy Wiseau himself.  Without him, it would still be the worst movie ever made, but with him  it is the greatest worst movie ever made. Tommy has been described as a  Cajun, a Croatian cyborg, possibly from Belgium, clearly a product of  Denmark, or maybe even not from this world or dimension. All of these  things are true at any one moment. He is a tantalizing mystery stuffed  inside an enigma wrapped in bacon and smothered in cheese. You will  fall in love with this man even as you are repelled by him from the  first moment he steps onto screen with his long Louis the Fourteenth  style black locks and thick triangular shoulders packed into an oddly  fitting suit, and his metallic steroid destroyed skin. Tommy looks out  of place, out of time and out of this world. There has never been  anything else like him. Nor will there ever be.  The Room begins with 'Johnny' (Tommy Wiseau) and his incomprehensibly  evil fiancée 'Lisa' (played by a woman with incongruously colored  eyebrows and a propensity for removing her shirt) engaging in some  light frottage, joined by, Denny, (played with a deft sense of the  absurd by Phillip Haldiman), their sexually confused teenage neighbor  who is clearly suffering from a form of aged decrepitude. When Denny,  who looks like the human version of Gleek the monkey from Superfriends,  says, in a slightly creepy yet playful tone of voice, 'I like to  watch!' as Johnny and Lisa roll around the bed in a pre-intercourse  ritual revolving around rose petals, you know you are in for a very  special movie.  After a lengthy lovemaking scene (not to worry if you miss it the first  time, they show it again in its entirety later in the movie) in which  Tommy's bizarre scaly torso and over-anatomized rear-end are lovingly  depicted over and over again as he appears to hump Lisa's hip, we  discover that Lisa, for no particular reason, has become bored with  Tommy's incessant lovemaking and decides to leave him.  Just when you think the movie might lapse into an ordinary, pedestrian  sort of badness, Johnny's best friend Mark, a man who's job seems to be  to wear James Brolin's beard from Amityville Horror, shows up and  electrifies the screen with a performance so wooden that it belongs in  the lumber section of Home Depot. Incidentally, Mark is played by Greg  Sestero, who, in addition to being described as a department store  mannequin, was also the line producer on 'The Room' and one of Tommy  Wiseau's five (5!!!!!) assistants on the movie. Lisa forces Mark, amid  his paltry, unconvincing protests, to have an affair with her on their  uncomfortable circular stairs. For no apparent reason Lisa decides that  she is made of pure evil and wants to torture her angelic and insanely  devoted fiancé, Johnny.  Lisa receives pointed advice from her mother who casually announces  that she is dying of breast cancer and then never mentions it again.  But Lisa is determined to make Johnny's life a living hell, in spite of  the fact that she, according to her mother, ""cannot survive on her own  in the cutthroat 'computer business'"". But not before they recycle the  sex scene from earlier in the movie where we get another bird's eye  view of Johnny's ludicrous naked body. Denny gets into trouble with a  drug dealer. Mark shaves his beard. Tommy gets drunk on an unusual  cocktail made from mixing whiskey and vodka. Lisa lies and tells  everyone that Tommy hit her in a drunken rage.  A balding psychologist appears out of nowhere, offers some advice, then  apparently dies while softly falling on the ground in an attempt to  catch a football thrown by Mark.  All of these seemingly disparate events build up to two cathartic  moments. The first is when Tommy expressively yells at Lisa with the  line 'You are tearing me apart Lisa!'. You will cheer at this line as  you realize that the film has been tearing you apart the whole time.  And the second is at Tommy's birthday party where the worst actor that  has ever been born plays a unidentified man wearing a silk shirt who  utters a phrase that perfectly describes the experience of watching The  Room,  'It feels like I'm sitting on atom bomb that is going to explode!'  The shocking ending will leave you pleading for some kind of sequel.  See this film at all costs. See it twice. Or three times. Or as one kid  that I met from Woodland Hills has, 12 times! See it until you can  recite every precious line of dialogue this movie has to offer. Let The  Room become your new religion and Tommy Wiseau your prophet preaching  the gospel according to Johnny.

No only did he makes ""Slugs"", he made ""Pieces"", too, and even took a crack at Jules Verne's ""Journey To The Center of the Earth"". I read Shaun Hutson's ""Slugs"" long before I experienced the movie, and I even read the sequel, ""Breeding Ground"", before seeing the movie. In three words, it is thoroughly disgusting entertainment, with echoes of Jeff Lieberman's great ""Squirm"". The Spanish/Mexican blending of scenes doesn't really work, but who cares? The film, like any Ed Wood or Rene Cardona film, is entertaining. The slug attacks are gory and unrestrained and Simon's direction of the little critters is better than his direction of the actors. Lap it up!"

This chiller with middling budget packs thrills, chills , some good action , gore , horror and few funny moments. It's a hybrid of monster movies from the 50s and modern American production in B series style . People are dying mysteriously and terrifyingly , and nobody has a track what the cause is . Only health inspector named Mike Brady (Michael Garfield) finds a possible origin , but his theory of murderous slugs is laughed at by the authorities . When his wife named Kim (Kim Terry) is attacked , he discovers that spilled toxic waste is being helpfully cleaned up by the slug population and causing countless deaths . Only when the slugs are mutating into blood-thirsty man eaters and the body count begins to rise , the police goes into the action .

She immediately begins plotting her getaway, as she wishes to track down the father she never knew. What she doesn't realize is that Mrs. Deere and her handyman, Tom Kredge, won't let anyone leave under any circumstances. If it comes down to murder, so be it.

1543,tt0066848,/review/rw1134912/?ref_=tt_urv,"""Blood And Lace"" is best described as a demented ""Grimm Fairy Tale"". After her prostitute mother is murdered, teen aged Ellie Masters (Melody Patterson) is sent to an isolated orphanage run by Mrs. Deere (Gloria Grahame) and her handyman (Len Lesser, now known as Uncle Lou on ""Seinfeld""). Taking an avid interest in her welfare is detective Calvin Carruthers (Vic Tayback, Mel from the ""Alice"" TV series). Taking almost no interest at all, is social worker Harold Mullins (Milton Selzer) who is completely under Mrs. Deere's thumb, or, as Lesser puts it ""under her skirt"". Lots of unpleasant surprises are in store for Our Heroine, not the least of which is the fact that Mrs. Deere and her handyman are both brutal sadists, who run the orphanage like a concentration camp. The film shows it's obviously low budget only too well, but it really doesn't matter. The script is very clever, Grahame is excellent as usual, and Patterson (of TV's ""F Troop"" fame), is appealing. The supporting players are all good, including a young Dennis Christopher, as one of the ""inmates"". Definitely ahead of it's time, ""Blood And Lace"" holds up remarkably well."
1544,tt0066848,/review/rw1543073/?ref_=tt_urv,"This odd and twisted 70's exploitation gem is incredibly hard to find these days, but definitely worth tracking down in case you're a fan of low-budget horror stuff that pioneered in shocking themes and abrupt plot twists. ""Blood and Lace"" was extremely ahead of its time back in 1971, with its story lines about child-abuse inside the walls of an orphanage, POV murder-sequences and incestuous relationships. The film is also quite explicit, as it displays - albeit with cheap make-up effects - the brutal murder of a sleeping couple with the sharp end of a hammer! And this right at the beginning of the film, so how's that for an intro? The woman who gets murdered is the prostitute-mother of the young and beautiful Ellie Masters. Since she never knew her real father, Ellie is sent to an orphanage ran by the corrupt Mrs. Deere and her sadistic handyman Tom. They have the nasty habit of torturing disobedient residents and even killing the ones that try to run away before storing their bodies in the basement freezer. If that isn't enough yet, there's a horribly deformed killing lurking around the orphanage with a meat cleaver. A police inspector whose interest in her is more than just professional closely follows Ellie's every move and proposes a strange offer in exchange for her rescue ""Blood & Lace"" benefices from an incredibly creepy atmosphere and the overall nihilistic tone often makes the film very disturbing. This is a genuine American drive-in exploitation flick, so you can expect the most offensive and politically incorrect situations imaginable! The acting performances also contribute a great deal to the film's power. Particularly Gloria Grahame (as Mrs. Deere) and Len Lesser (Tom) portray nightmarish characters you certainly don't want to interfere with. Naturally, the budget was far too low for one-time director Philip Gilbert to play with imaginative camera angles or visual tricks, but that's okay, since ""Blood and Lace"" purely relies on shocks and cruelty. You won't believe your eyes and ears on more than just one occasion! Highly recommended super B-trash of the seventies!"

1550,tt0453533,/review/rw1633625/?ref_=tt_urv,"One of the ""8 Films To Die For"" that was part of the After Dark Horror Film Festival in November 2006, ""Unrest"" boasts a unique idea for a story. The film centers around a group of medical students, mainly Allison (Corri English). She groups up with a few guys in her new anatomy class to begin dissection on a cadaver. She is a little grossed out by the entire thing, and begins feeling an uncomfortable presence when around the corpse, which appears to be a woman who was either murdered or killed herself. Of course, nobody thinks anything of Allison's strange feelings around the corpse, and dismiss it as her being a little paranoid, since it is her first time working with a cadaver. But they soon believe her when strange things start happening around the school. And those who came in contact with the cadaver begin to die one by one. But why? The identity of the body may hold the secret, and it's up to Allison to find out."
1551,tt0453533,/review/rw1669353/?ref_=tt_urv,"This is the ""8 Films"" movie that claims to be the first movie to use a REAL human corpse! Spooky! It's debatable whether that is true, and it's never obvious which one in the movie is a real corpse, so I'm not sure they should have went to the trouble. The ""moral"" of the story is ""don't mess with dead bodies,"" so this is a rather ironic marketing angle to take. Anywho, ""Unrest"" takes place in a hospital, where young medical student Alison and her Abercrombie model cohorts are cuttin' up cadavers. Alison lives in the hospital until her financial aid kicks through, and they apparently spend all the time they aren't sleeping (or changing into new scrubs) carving up the same old cadaver. It must be a very resilient corpse! Most of the movie is filmed in the hospital or the confines of Alison's closet-like room. This may just be due to budget restraints, but I thought it created a claustrophobic atmosphere. Considering the lead never leaves the hospital floor and spends half her time with a chopped up corpse and male models pretending to be med students, she has plenty of time to let her mind wander. When random things start happening and she gets a funny feeling in her tummy, she decides that the corpse is trying to tell her something. What, she doesn't know. The evil corpse's alleged antics are amusing, and lead to some nasty killings and bizarre sequences. One of these features our heroes swimming around in a tub of formaldehyde, unaffected by the chemical, even though they're swallowing it and getting it in their eyes. ""Unrest"" is yet another silly poorly-written movie in the 8 FILMS TO DIE FOR series, but it has its fair share of scares, and is entertaining despite its flaws."
1552,tt0453533,/review/rw1526373/?ref_=tt_urv,"Like all of After Dark's Horrorfest films Unrest is an interesting selection but unlike most of the others the film is pretty successful at what it aims to do, most of which is entertain. Unrest tells the original and inventive story of a group of med students who disrespect a cadaver and pay the price for it. The film's storyline is a little more complex and campy than that but the other stuff is better seen and not read about. This film works because it's cheesy, it doesn't take itself too seriously. And because of the silliness sometimes it inspires laughs that I believe are mostly intentional. The main performance by Corri English is quite impressive and the cast is very attractive and talented. The film is creepy but not terrifying and does sport some grotesque med lab imagery and a terrifying sequence inside a cadaver tank. I'm not sure if I really enjoyed this film because the rest of them were pretty much stinkers, or if it was because it had better sound and film quality. But one thing is for sure I did enjoy this film the most. It offers more of what i came to see little horror gems that are never seen by mainstream audiences. It's graphic, a little disturbing, original and memorable. Unrest may not be a great film but it's very good at what it's supposed to be. It rattles your nerves and brings something new to the table. what else can you ask for, in a horror film?It's also very impressive for the simple reason that it had such a low budget and manages to have such a great creepy but some what over the top score and uses it's surroundings so greatly never reducing itself into using cheesy cgi. It instead opts for a more traditional and story based approach, which it pulls off nicely"

One hundred years on , the only male descendant of the Marino family , returns his village . After 15 years, Tomas (Gorka Otxoa) , a not very successful writer, comes back to the village in Galicia where his family comes from , Arga , apparently to get an award . He returns home to a warm welcome from the villagers but things aren't quite what they seem. After a century of being terrorized by the vicious werewolf, they plan to break the curse by sacrificing him 100 years to the day when the original curse fell . But he doesn't know the real reason why he is there, to end with an old curse that is been haunting the village for the last hundred years . At the village he meets an old friend (Carlos Areces) , his editor (Secun de la Rosa) , the priest (Manuel Manquiña) and a bit later on appears his grandmother (Mabel Rivera) .

His werewolves will have maximum special effects and stunts but minimum computer graphics. With a limited budget (much of which went on hair from China), Moreno dishes up a picture that is by turns seriously scary and seriously funny. Meet Thomas, a hapless failed writer who holes up in his parental village of Galicia, Northern Spain. A hundred years ago, his great grandmother cursed the village after abducting and forcing a gypsy to procreate with her. Thomas doesn't know a werewolf is out to get him. He doesn't know the villagers are out to get him. Mayhem ensues. But with a cutting edge comedy narrative you'd better examine yourself for bruises after you leave the cinema. When you laugh that hard, it's easy to forget the damage from where you kept jumping out of your seat. Lobos de Arga is a frank and sincere homage to movies such as An American Werewolf, and swooped the audience awards at the Edinburgh Dead by Dawn horror film festival to come first in competition."

Amazingly, director William Fruet (FUNERAL HOME) gets the cast to play this entirely straight with Reed - who shot the snake themed VIPER (1981) the same year - really throwing himself into his crazy part (even if he seems to be whispering every line). The attack scenes are really well staged (a sorority house siege being the highlight) and DP Mark Irwin makes the movie look way better than it should. Dick Smith handled the gooey special effects; the bursting bodies are great 80s bladder effects but the snake is kept offscreen for the most part.

But at least one man undergoes such massive spasms he first tranforms into Robert Z'Dar, then pops. Not much more I can ask for than that.

You got two leads who were very young at the time, who would later become Oscar winning A list actors.... that's pretty shocking to see in a film like this lol. I loved Renee Zellweger here, I actually think she and Matthew are the only good actors here, the rest are pretty laughable. But ya know this film really doesn't take itself very seriously at all, so it's fun to laugh at the atrocious acting, mainly given by the actress that plays Heather. Matthew McConaughey is absolutely bonkers here, like sometimes he's just crazy to be crazy. That's one of the many reasons this film is never boring... it's entertaining as hell to watch Matthew play this crazy over the top character. I had fun with the chainsaw chase scenes and actually did get kinda tense while Leatherface was chasing Jenny. I have absolutely no clue why Leatherface is a transvestite in this film, that's just one of the weird things they put in here, like the mechanical leg and the weird government thing.

To add to that, there's a melodramatic sub plot about the killing of campus security head Jim MacVey's (Hal Holbrook) daughter once upon a time, which is going to prove to be important to the story later. Name actor Holbrook is clearly slumming here, and looks rather weary; his appearance certainly must have something to do with the fact that his son David is also in the movie playing the pivotal role of Mike Prior, a volatile athlete. But it is great novelty to see him here, and it's a treat to see the other adult actors, lovely Rutanya Alda as Barney (!), and her husband Richard Bright as the detective who shows up on the scene. Other familiar faces include some slasher alumni: Lauren-Marie Taylor (""Friday the 13th Part 2"") and Carrick Glenn (""The Burning""), and of course ravishing lead Julia Montgomery was Betty Childs in ""Revenge of the Nerds"". The problem that this viewer has with this movie is that it gets a little tiresome after a while. Yes, it does have some things going for it: the addition of a scavenger hunt helps to create a somewhat playful approach, as well as the bear costume (it is a hoot to see a slasher villain wearing something like this), the soundtrack features golden oldies like ""Summer in the City"" and ""Do You Believe in Magic"", and the killer's weapon of choice automatically calls to mind the glove made famous by Freddy in ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" two years later. There is some atmosphere and suspense and a little bit of gore. However, in order to get to this movie's good stuff, one has to sit through a lot of dopey comedy & tomfoolery, and emphasis on character relationships before the pacing picks up at all. The beginning is pretty good, but the ending, once our psycho's identity is revealed, is fairly abrupt and not altogether satisfying. At least the calls that this person places to both campus DJ Kaiser (Larry Mintz) and MacVey are good for major amusement. Underwhelming overall, but does have its moments here and there.

The film opens in Romania as soldiers uncover the underground tomb of the Dracula family. A soldier pulls the stake out of a puffy sheet in an opened casket and is soon bit to death by a giant of a hound(A Great Dane I believe). This is Zoltan and he soon pulls the stake out of his master - not Dracula but his servant - and the two begin a trek to the United States to turn the last surviving family member into their undead master. On the heels of these two is Inspector Branco who is well-versed in vampirism and folklore. Anyway, the two follow the Drake family to the woods where they camp and soon all hell breaks out as Zoltan begins to infect all the canines around. The plot sounds ridiculous - and it is, but it strangely works as reasonable entertainment. The actors are all decent with Jose Ferrer lending cachet and clout as Branco. He does a fine job bringing some much needed credibility, though I must confess seeing him drive in a convertible in black slacks, a black turtleneck, and a black beret is something not to be missed. The odd servant is played by none other than Reggie Nalder who just looks evil and up to no good. Throughout the movie he commands Zoltan telepathically. The rest of the cast is serviceable as well. Michael Pataki is believable as the last member of Castle Dracula and even plays the count in a flashback sequence. The dogs do a good job and the director Albert Band, despite a lack of any sizable budget and some real poor lighting, creates just enough suspense and tension to keep this dubious project somewhat afloat. Don't expect any real scares, but there are a few scenes that are well-shot: the dogs attacking the small rented cottage and the dogs attacking the car are just a couple to mention. I saw the denouement coming early in the picture, but is was pretty neat any way. The special effects are nothing really more than the eyes of the vampiric dogs glowing.

1574,tt0164143,/review/rw4035215/?ref_=tt_urv,"THE PSYCHOTRONIC MAN is an indie horror flick that seems to have been made in order to rip-off PSYCHIC KILLER, the entertaining little video nasty wannabe. This one's a very cheap-looking film with muted colours and on-the-street camerawork; if you're familiar with the kinds of thrillers put out by Vinegar Syndrome then you'll know the look. An ordinary guy discovers a talent for killing people with his mental powers so he goes on a random killing spree while the cops hunt him down. It's not very gory or suspenseful, and the acting is as basic as you'd expect, but I did enjoy the first half of this movie. Sadly, the second half gets way too bogged down in silly slow motion action scenes which merely act as padding in order to get the running time up to the required length, but drag the pacing down to a snail's crawl in the process."

And I mean awhile. It was the title that caught my eye ""Revenge of the Psychotronic Man"". It screams ""Hey, look at me""! Anyhow what I got myself into was something bug-eyed. Think of ""The Incredible Melting Man"", which was made a couple years earlier and the tone is similar, but without the graphic context. Still it wasn't as bad as I thought it might be, but you can see why it's virtually unknown. While being a penniless production, its clunky, dry and tawdry nature remains for most part rather entertaining. Why is it entertaining because of just how unusual and surprisingly twisted it plays out? Even when it seems to concentrate on uneventful filler, there's something unnervingly atmospheric and random that makes it hypnotic. Even when some scenarios are risible (like the first death with the constant slow-motion) and long-winded (there's a lot of driving going on). Something which would hit you straight away would be the creepy score that overpowers many sequences and that of some oddball sound-effects like the ominous bell chimes that comes and goes. You get more of a rush from the music than the visual action. The direction is virtually non-existent, but the gritty location work of Chicago and the shadowy imagery gives it a bit of a moody edge. While the performances are on the stilted side, but durable enough and dialogues remain lacklustre. Bemusing low-grade horror Sci-fi."

I'm not the biggest fan of his movies but when's he good, he's good. I was happy to see Ferrell had the nerve to release a small movie, low budget with deliberately poor production value, and completely in Spanish. In a time when so many American moviegoers refuse to sit through a movie they'll need to ""read"", you've got to love what you do to go against the grain with a film like CASA DE MI PADRE. Good for Ferrell and his film buddies for doing the movie, and the best part isI actually enjoyed it. Well, not at first. The movie is done in the style of Mexican/Spanish telenovelas. It's a feature length soap opera/Spanish western, and I know that alone will turn some people off. It is the tale of Armando Alvarez (Ferrell), a simple ranchero working on his father's land when his beloved brother Raul makes a triumphant return to their homestead with exciting news. Raul (Diego Luna) is to be married to the beautiful Sonia (Genesis Rodriguez) and he has plans to revive his father's dying ranch.

Soon everyone around him begins to act very cold and strange. What can be the cause of this? Maybe the strange spaceship that landed in the abandoned field is causing this? Well it was the 80's.

But even sci-fi aficionados seem to have been losing their sense of fun over the years, which may be why this remake has been panned so badly.  The whole movie is viewed from a young boy's dark imagination, right down to the ridiculous Mr. Potato head aliens.  Even the camera angles are taken from child's height.  And within the bizarre dream world of adolescent fears and disempowerment springs forth a really fun movie.  Within this context, the remake of Invaders from mars remains true to the 1950's genre with some tongue in cheek.

Rewatching is a must; there are so many great jokes written and they are delivered so well by Will Forte and the rest of the cast. They will make you laugh again and again and have a fun evening. SNL short Macgruber was one of the best of Will forte and of the writing team, delivering great jokes within 30 seconds, mocking in a sweet and respectful way the old classic series of Mcgyver and his adventures.
Maybe have a look in YouTube for these SNL shorts if you are not familiar with Mcgruber and this comedy style and you see right away what's this all about. It will make you understand some references but even as a stand-alone film, it delivers. If you like (or liked) SNL and if you are a fun of comedies with Will Ferrell, Andy Samberg or Seth Rogen/James Franco, then you will appreciate the humor and the hilarity of this film.11/10 hilarious."

Of course it's a dumb ridiculous movie but I wasn't paying attention to the plot, I watched laughing my ass off the entire time.

Adam Green shud be applauded for making such an entertaining brutal slasher n considering its low budget, he did a mighty fine job.
There is something sinister about horror films set in the bayou, especially Louisiana n Green made full use of the settings. I had complained in my review of the first part about the no usage of crocodiles in such settings. If only there was some short crocodile terror in this installment, i wud have loved it even more.

In short the story is of Travis McGee, a Private detective hired to investigate the death of a woman who's sister has been murdered. McGee discoverers the murderer is none other than William Smith who plays Terry Bartell. Smith is awesome in this role and anyone who gazes on that extraordinary physique of his will be impressed his good looks match his formidable strength. Adding to the interest of this film are sympathetic Theodore Bikel as Meyer and Suzy Kendall who doubles as Vangie/Merrimay. Travis and his friends plan an elaborate scheme in which the victim will return to haunt her murderer. What they don't know is that their intended mark is as explosive, unpredictable and dangerous as a lit bundle of dynamite. The final physical confrontation is one of the finest ever recorded on film.

But it is a tough one to get to see in its entirety, as some of the other reviewers have noted. Even the commercial prints have a running time of 91 minutes, and they are obviously and clumsily cut (here's a clue: the background music and sound jump drastically). No doubt this is because the violence is graphic for a film of this vintage, although that doesn't explain why it almost impossible to find a complete 93-minute copy here in the 21st century. I found one through a guy who knew a guy and so on--a Dutch copy with Dutch subtitles--and after 30 years of poking around (I was doing other things, too, during these decades) I finally got to see the whole movie. And it was worth it, as it almost always is to see the entire work, as the director (Clouse's next film was ""Enter the Dragon"") intended it. Some might think 2 minutes out of a film is no big deal (although they might gripe if you handed them a novel with 2 or 3 percent of its pages torn out) but this is too good a movie to snip. And although there have been bigger, longer, bloodier, more you-name-it fights, no two men on screen have ever looked like they are really, desperately trying to hurt each other as much as Rod Taylor and William Smith in the climactic fight in this movie. If you can find it, watch it. Good luck."

Derek, Sam, and Derek's uncle Charle (the solid Christopher Shyer) all join forces to try to figure out a way to stop Toblat before he kills again. Writer/director Lance W. Dreesen offers a fresh and novel spin on the standard werewolf premise by cleverly blending the more horrific elements with a surprisingly potent and touching domestic drama. The main characters are unexpectedly engaging (Sam in particular is simply awesome, thanks mainly to Brown's winningly sparky portrayal of her), the acting overall acceptable, and the story unfolds at a constant steady pace. Popping up in nice cameos are Clint Howard as grubby hick Fulton Chaney and David Naughton as friendly Sheriff Joe Ruben. The nasty, hulking, wisecracking werewolf makes for a ferocious and frightening monster: the savage beast rips off heads, tears people to pieces, rapes women, and even brutally castrates one poor guy (ouch!). Dana Nu's spooky'n'shuddery score, Stephen Crawford's bright, polished cinematography, and the funky special effects are all uniformly up to par.

Number one: Hello! It's a movie about a giant killer frog monster! What more reason do you need? We've seen angry frogs before in the early 70's eco-horror trash fest ""Frogs"", but they were only normal sized and boring killer frogs! Plus, one of the taglines I encountered stated: ""This time, the frog dissects you!"" Best cheesy tagline ever! Number two: this is another accomplishment of the notoriously awful director Bill Rebane, who also made the insufferable creature features ""Giant Spider Invasion"" and ""The Capture of Bigfoot"". Of course, in my wild enthusiasm, I actually forgot that this thing is probably rare and ultra-obscure for a good reason. Could it possibly be any worse than the other Rebane stinkers, like the aforementioned ones and also ""The Demons of Ludlow"" and ""Monster-a-Go- Go""? Oh yes, sire! This is bad film-making in the purest meaning of the term: long boring stretches of footage that is completely irrelevant, one-dimensional characters, inept dialogs and a total absence of excitement and bloody action. The titular monster is nowhere to be seen until late in the film, but unlike as in ""Jaws"", you'd wish they never bothered to show it at all once you finally see it. Speaking of ""Jaws"", there are multiple more heavy influences from that film, like the music and the underwater P.O.V. shots, but I can hardly hold that against Bill Rebane because practically all horror movies around that time imitated the successful gimmicks of Spielberg's summer blockbuster. The plot is narrated by a guy, as some sort of warm fireplace story to his girlfriend in their holiday cabin, and describes a traumatizing encounter of his own childhood. In the story, the narrator is an 8-year- old kid, living with his father near a swamp. After the mysterious disappearance of an anthropologist in the area, another much better looking anthropologist of the female kind comes to investigate. More and more people start to vanish in the swamp, like poachers, but obviously nobody believe the crazy old guy when he says that the legendary frog monster is to be blamed. Rana, as he/she/it is called, looks more like the inbred cousin of Creature from the Black Lagoon than like a frog or any type of amphibian whatsoever. ""Rana"" is pretty boring during the first hour, but then suddenly quite a lot happens in the span of only a few minutes. One of the characters stumbles over a skull with the eyes still in its sockets, there's a gunfight in slow-motion at the pier and the monster's claws can be admired as he crushes the head of a poacher into a tree. After these three minutes of outrageous action, everything gets boring and tedious again. Couldn't you have spread the a little, Mr. Rebane?"

I was familiar with the fact that Turkish directors/producers bluntly imitated the biggest blockbusters during the 70's and 80's, but I've never actually seen one. I laughed quite hard over the sight of such titles like ""Seytan: Turkish Exorcist"" and ""Last House in Istanbul"", so I was very enthusiast when a buddy of mine told me he got hold of the one and only ""Turkish Superman"". You can tell right away from the opening sequences that this will become a non-stop spitfire of hysterical laughter and stomach aches, and you don't even have to be drunk or intoxicated! It begins with an allegedly mysterious voice-over whilst the camera atmospherically browses through space. The galaxy, however, exists of second-hand Christmas decoration. When we witness Superman flying for the first time, he looks like a Ken Barbie doll hanging by a thread in front drawn clouds and people waving at him from the deck of a ship. It's brilliant, truly brilliant! Clark Kent, named Tyfun in Turkish, is a tremendous dork with a spectacular pair of glasses and he walks around like there's a cloth hanger stuck in his suit. His nemesis isn't bald like Lex Luthor is, but actually looks a lot like the Turkish version of Lee Van Cleef. The most striking thing about ""Turkish Superman"" is how very anti- spectacular it is! Our hero hides behind trees, doesn't bother much to hide his double identity and conducts the lamest rescue operations ever. Superman stops an out-of-control truck descending a mountain road, NOT by jumping in front of it, NOT by pushing it back up a cliff and NOT by pulling the rear end like he's an anchor Superman stops the truck by taking place behind the wheel and using the brakes. Oh, how heroic! I guess the budget didn't allow them to wreck the truck. That's also the same reason why the lead actress drives a Lada instead of a real car. The fight sequences are hilarious as well, since they look like a bunch of heavily mustached men group-hugging each other. The creators of ""Turkish Superman"" didn't just steal the plot of ""Superman"" but also the soundtrack of James Bond. The scene where Superman single-handedly prevents a train collision from happening is perhaps even the ultimate highlight of the film. According to the most rudimentary rules of physics his rescue act is just impossible, I don't care if you're a superhero or not."

Journeyman director Curtis Harrington(Whoever Slew Auntie Roo, What's the Matter with Helen?, and several other genre credits)directs with his usual touch.

Despite all these problems, the average yet solid direction, the cheap feel that comes with a seventies TV production, ridiculous special effects, I found myself thoroughly engrossed from start to finish.

As for the cast Crenna always does a workmanlike job, Yvette Mimieux is eerily good, Ike Eisenmann and Kim Richards(the Witch Mountain kids) are sickeningly sweet and evil and perfect in this concoction of unreality, and the film boasts a minor array of interesting cameos with Victor Jory, Barbara Steele, and R. G. Armstrong(soon to be Uncle Lewis Vendredi in the TV Friday the 13th: the Series)."

How could you dislike a movie where the family dog makes the mom become the town slut, the kids become the school bully, and make the entire family (except dad) worship Satan in the attic.

D'Amato's film certainly is a landmark in the Italian shlock/sick cinema as it contains some of the grossest and explicit nauseating sequences ever shot on film. The young and introvert Frank cannot live without his recently deceased girlfriend Anna, so he digs up her corpse, embalms her and keeps her around his mansion. After this, he descents further into madness and starts to kill girls randomly and his freaky housekeeper Iris assists him. Now, Frank is pretty messed up in the head but Iris is just downright insane!! She makes a hobby out of dismembering dead bodies and she breastfeeds the 22-year-old Frank! The first half hour may seem a little lame and low on bloodshed but, as soon as the gore kicks in, it doesn't stop till the end credits role and it becomes more and more repulsive by the minute! D'Amato servers a disturbingly realistic embalming-process along with some detailed torturing scenes, dissections and gruesome butchering! Of course, like it should in Italian's nastiest, there are a lot of perversely orientated undertones present such as necrophilia, cannibalism and even a variant on the Oedipus'-theme!"

1635,tt0341564,/review/rw1223884/?ref_=tt_urv,"This movie could be used in film classes in a ""How Not to Script a B-Movie"" course. There are inherent constrictions in a B-movie: Budgets are tight, Time is precious (Scarecrow was apparently shot in 8 days) and the actors are often green and inexperienced. The one aspect you have complete control over is writing the best script you can within the limitations set before you. Scarecrow's script seems to have been written in a drunken haze. I could go through about fifteen examples of the nonsensical scripting of this movie, but I'll just mention one: The Gravedigger. The character of the gravedigger is introduced about an hour into the movie. He seemingly has no connection to any of the other characters already in the movie. He is shown with his daughter, who also has no connection to anybody else in the movie. The gravedigger is given a couple scenes to act surly in and then is killed to pad out the body count. Why give the Gravedigger a daughter? Why give the daughter a boyfriend? Why introduce them so late in the movie? Why not try to make them part of the ongoing storyline? Scarecrow doesn't seem to care."

Scarecrow has the production values of a recent Full Moon picture (not the great, older stuff) and the ridiculousness of a Troma pic (it even has a Tromette).  This is one of those movies where you can immediately start picking out who the misguided ""hero"" is going to kill later on.  It's a tad predictable in that department.  That's not a problem though.  The problem is that I have to once again force myself to believe that late 20-somethings are high school kids.  There are no high school kids in this movie.  Lester, the main character, has gotta be in his late 20's.  His mother looks younger than him.  In fact, it could not have been his mother, unless she had him when she was four.  It also features the worst director cameo ever.  It's this crazy French director making an ass out of himself.  It is fun to laugh at.  I will give them that.  This is one of the funnier direct-to-video movies I've ever seen.  And the guy that played the boyfriend/sheriff was hilarious.  I love his wig.  Let's not forget ""scarecrow ninjitsu.""  That is some laugh-out-loud sh*t.  The one thing this movie does have in its favor is the scarecrow design.  Honestly, it's one kick-ass mask.  I also find it respectable that they completed the film in eight days.  That's insane. However, if you want to see a real ""mothalovin' landmine of evil,"" go watch Dark Night of the Scarecrow or Scarecrows (1988) instead."

Here are a few for you to sample: How did these murderers who are in high school kill William's wife and daughter over ten years ago? Did they kill them when they were 6 years old? Why doesn't William just kill them himself or turn them into the police? Why are they waiting ten years to train this little girl while other women are being murdered when they already know who the killers are and could stop them? Why does Veronica have a crush on William? He adopted her when she was a little girl and is basically her father. Isn't this messed up? Why does William tickle her? That was so weird! Why do they choke out that random guy at the bar? Why can't she just shoot them? If a gun without bullets is a paperweight why can't she just take more bullets? Why isn't she allowed to wear shoes? If she's going to drug them why can't she just poison them? What woman in their right mind would wear formal attire and drive into the woods with four men they just met? Why does it take her so long to kill these bozos when she's been training for ten years and they are drugged? Why is this guy so scared of pandas? I thought she wasn't allowed to use a gun so why does William shoot the last guy? Why didn't he shoot them ten years ago? If he was there the whole time with a gun why was he letting her try and fist fight them to death when he could have easily killed them? Who made this movie?

""Henry"" was an intense and harrowing shock-drama, partly based on horrible real-life events, whereas this crazy flick revolves on naughty aliens banished from their planet and killer headaches! ""The Borrower"" is an endurable and occasionally even fun little flick, but it lacks a proper script and especially that last half hour lingers on enormously. This low-budget B-movie opens with images inside an alien spaceship as it heads for earth to drop off a banished member of their intergalactic community. The opening is pretty funny, as the alien refers to human beings as the absolute lowest forms of life and getting sent to earth is actually a punishment far worse than execution. Gee thanks, Mr. Alien! We like your planet, too. The rest of the film is reminiscent of ""The Hidden""; only the alien's modus operandi to switch hosts is a whole lot messier. Whenever the unfriendly visitor runs out of energy or gets damaged, he simply rips off the head of any poor person (or dog) that stands too close and attaches it to his own body. His first victim is a redneck hunter (the ultra-cool Tom Towles of ""House of 1.000 Corpses"") and the alien uses his head to go to the big city and run a little amok there. Meanwhile, the ambitious female detective Diana Pierce pursues an escaped psycho-killer and naturally both story lines will neatly come together in the end. The crazy head-transplant aspect results in some excellent splatter-sequences and a fair amount of delightful black humor. Also, and as some other reviewers already mentioned, the film is even mildly effective as a social commentary pointing out all the issues of life in the big city. Too bad about the imbecile and downright crappy ending. It almost seems like McNaughton completely lost interest in finishing the film properly."

We clueless humans are portayed as a strange bunch in the eyes of an alien criminal, who has been sentenced to the worst punishment on his planet: Life as a human!  The human form is not entirely compatible with this species' biology, the annoying result being the head's tendency to explode.

While the film is Italian, it was shot in north Georgia, and it's a good visual record of the area. But I was surprised to find a very entertaining movie as well. It's a silly romp starring the action star Bud Spencer and the little kid from Close Encounters, a few years older than he was then. They are a perfect match, clearly enjoying each other, even as the Spencer character is being driven crazy by his pint-size friend. Basically the kid is an alien and Bud is a sheriff (this is a sequel to The Sheriff and the Satellite Kid, which I now also have gotten from ebay on the strength of this) who is protecting the kid from the government. Bad aliens set up shop in the same small town our heros wind up in, and it is up to these two to bust some heads. The violence can be a bit extreme, but in a cartoony way. The movie is colorful and fun (with a fantastic theme song), and sweet without being at all saccharine. It seems loopier and less facile than an American production probably would have been. The small dusty town has several maraudering gangs (like cowboys who throw dynamite around and bikers who wear silly costumes) and the aforementioned themepark is shot as though it were simply a section of town.

The film is pretty much what you'd expect from a Bud Spencer sci-fi comedy: full of endearingly cheesy special effects and slapsticky fight scenes (the highlight is one set in a laundry, with one bad guy going through a pressing machine!). It drags a little in spots and has some pretty poor scene transitions (in one scene the kid stumbles and falls into a lake, next time we see him he's lying on his bed with a fever), but Bud Spencer fans and kids (the primary target audience) should enjoy it. **1/2 out of 4."

It has some imaginative camera shots, an intriguing storyline, and some unique, definitely not mainstream humour.  The story about the humdrum nature of flying in space for an interminable time has several layers peeled in the script.  If I judged the film solely on those merits, it would indeed do well.  However, the film has a snail's pace and some uneven plot twists, not to mention some not very good acting.  Many of Carpenter's  soon-to-be-signature trademarks are clearly evident in this film.  No denying it, the man has talent.  The film was made with a shoestring budget, but Carpenter and crew do a workmanlike job with the resources they had.  Clearly, the greatest appreciation for this film is not for the product itself but for the potential and early, evident development of Carpenter and to a lesser degree O' Bannon."

Well, they have seen very little or perhaps they have not realized how often they are fed with very bad movie junk, under the disguise of art or top entertainment... As I enjoyed the films animated by Ray Harryhausen, with their cyclops, harpies, Medusas, fighting skeletons, or giants as the unforgettable Thalos (from Jason and the Argonauts), what I saw I enjoyed very much -except for the score, which has become a plague in almost all American cinema of today, a mixture of pastiche sounds inherited from Jerry Goldsmith and all the others, plus the obnoxious little rock number for the end credits. The tension falters a bit in the very last moment, when the thousands of corpses are about to be reanimated, but for the rest it was fine airhead entertainment. If you are looking to have a good time with another fable of the struggle of agents of Good against the Evil, with no romance out of place (between the monster and a scientist?), efficient special effects and the fast rhythm of American (or Australian, for the case) adventure film, watch it, and leave Malick, Weerasethakul or Sorrentino for another time.

First, it seemed to follow from the book events and made a good point that the creature is not actually called Frankenstein. However, the ""creature"" itself, played by a strong Aaron Eckhart (Harvey Dent in Dark Knight) did not look like any previous incarnation. Mostly, it looked like a normal-sized, muscular, even handsome man with scars, not like a tall, grotesque, patchwork of a man as it should have been. So, the film following this trend of making ""monsters"" sexy bugged me, but the performance of Eckhart won me over. He might not have emoted much, as befitted the character who didn't learn how, but he certainly had the charisma and gravitas necessary. He didn't look the part but he acted the haunted, grim part very well."

1746,tt0096246,/review/rw2162190/?ref_=tt_urv,"A Roger Corman quickly produced cheapie that wears its influences proudly, as many elements (character descriptions to lifted sequence ideas) just reek of Ridley Scott's 1979 feature ''Alien''. However this systematic fodder remains enjoyable (for most part, despite its often lumpy pacing) on a very b-grade level, as it doesn't pretend to be anything else than cheap, exploitative fun. Instead of being set in space like that classic, the action takes place in a post-apocalyptic setting due to a chemically induced plague wiping out the majority of the earth's population. Nevertheless a small bunch of scientists are holding up in an underground laboratory in the bone-dry desert, but their existence is soon threatened by genetic mutations known as gargoyles. These beasties are quite randy too, because at nearly every opportunity they go out of their way to impregnate the women. What the story lacks in imagination (as it does draw upon a predictable amalgam) and coherence, it makes up for in durable performances (a likable Andrew Stevens, George Kennedy, John Lafayette, Starr Andreeff and Terri Treas all keeping it straight) and gruesomely tacky splatter (even though it doesn't have much impact in engineering the deaths and tawdry jolts). Being rough and crude, it's kind of similar in style / budget to the likes of ''Creepazoids'' and ""Parasite"". The creatures are kept off screen during the first half, to only be heard and getting some POV shots. Nonetheless we do get to see them, and it's a fair looking monster design of a man in a rubber suit. Everything looks low-rent, which is cemented by its compact setting and stuffily framed direction but still lingering within is a grim atmosphere. The music score tagged to the project isn't too bad either, being high-strung but ominously pitched. Mechanically uninspired, but gruellingly cheesy entertainment."

There are also problems with the plot as there are several things in it that kind of do not work. The cast is okay, a lot better than a film with a similar theme, ""Xtro 2"".

""The Wizard of Gore"" might not be his 'best' film, but it's definitely a fun experience and actually one of Lewis' most ambitiously plotted films, since he toys with subjects like hypnotism and optical illusions. None of the magical tricks are properly explained, as Lewis' sneakily avoids that in the dumb finale, but at least he tried to do something extra and ingenious with this film. Ray Sager, some sort of crossover between Vincent Price and porn actor Harry Reems, plays Montag The Magnificent; a self-acclaimed illusionist genius who butchers girls from the audience live on stage but has them return to their seats again in one piece. A young reporter, who's always dragged along by his girlfriend to see Montag's shows, discovers that the girls turn up dead after all and their corpses are damaged exactly like they appeared to be on stage. It's rather curious how you never grow tired of the way Lewis displays the gore in his movies! The sequences here in which female bodies are disemboweled, impaled or even crushed with an industrial punch press are overlong, monotonous and completely implausible, yet you stare at the screen with a gigantic smile on your face. Of course, these are the only significant scenes in ""The Wizard of Gore"" as the rest of the film hangs together by lousy acting, embarrassing dialogues and a shortage of decors. By the year 1970 and after having unleashed a handful of similar horror movies already, Lewis still couldn't care less about building up tension or continuity and went straight for exploitative grossness.

In this movie, the wonderfully hammy Ray Sager plays the Wizard and his main occupation seems to be delivering quasi-fascistic prattle to audiences with mutton chop sideburns, interspersed with running his fingers through the tomato-sauce covered animal organs that erupt from his victims, all to the audience's delight. There is some weak storyline involving an independent woman reporter and her well-tanned boyfriend, who try to solve the mystery of the Wizard, the fools. However, this is pretty much just window dressing for the 5-6 gory scenes of the Wizard doing his thing. In particular, there is an eyeball poking and manipulating scene that would have done Lucio Fulci proud. And please don't forget the awesome furniture and late 60's bourgeois home furnishings and polyester pantsuits that make all of these late 60's films look like ""Barbarella"" by todays standards. If anything, you have to love the fact that there was actually a time in this country where you could make a movie like this and it would be distributed.

For example, a white rose is seen by the bedside of each of the females who have been bitten. Once they drink blood the rose turns red. I thought that was an interesting touch. Having said that though, I thought there were a couple of faults as well. First, the dialogue was awful. But the movie I saw was originally in Japanese and dubbed in English and it is quite possible that much had been simplified or even lost in translation. Likewise, the acting was also quite bad. Even so, this film had a different flavor than most other vampire movies and I thought some of it was actually quite good. Obviously, there will be people who might not like this film.

Here, and in some beautiful long shots, it shows that some skill was involved, and that the movie could have become a minor classic if it had stuck to the Japanese tradition of the Horror Film.

Actually, total absence of use of the crucifix to save the day is presumably something to do with the Japanese not wanting to elevate the importance of such alien paraphernalia, but thats just a guess. So, bit more action here, bit more colour and a bit more sexed up too with small amount of nudity here and there."

Disappointingly, that brand is conspicuously absent here, with John Huston in a relatively brief supporting role, the only 'marquee' import, and little to none of the gory special effects usually synonymous with a Cardona picture."

When I got my hands on The Bermuda Triangle, I was expecting the usual stuff  planes and ships disappearing at sea, unknown lights, and the ocean changing colors. While The Bermuda Triangle gives you all this, Cardona has stuffed the movie with so much more including: a possessed doll, a girl who talks to dead people, sharks, underwater earthquakes, parrot attacks, hurricanes, and more. None of it is fleshed-out very well, but boy is it fun."

1765,tt0104053,/review/rw1830167/?ref_=tt_urv,"Dario Argento's ""Trauma"" of 1993 is definitely one of this great director's lesser films, but it is nevertheless a more than decent Thriller and better than most 90s Horror films. The 90s were a bad decade for Horror in general, and definitely also the worst decade in Dario Argento's career, with his doubtlessly worst movie ""Il Fantasma Dell' Opera"" in 1998. ""Two Evil Eyes"" of 1990 which he made with George A. Romero, was also a good Horror film, but not nearly as great as a film by Romero and Argento could have been. ""Trauma"" is definitely not comparable to Argento's masterpieces from the 70s and 80s. As far as I am considered, however, Argento is one of the greatest Horror directors of all-time, and films like ""Suspiria"", ""Profondo Rosso"" or ""Phenomena"" range high in my personal all-time favorite list. Even Argento's weaker films are usually above average, and ""Trauma"" is a more than decent film that easily outshines the majority of 90s Horror efforts."

I don't agree. Sure, there is a certain sense of ""half-baked Argento"" here and there, but I don't find that to be a minus point. If anything, being made in the states, it has more convincing performances and the production values can not be faulted. It's look may seem aneamic if viewed beside ""Suspiria"" or something more of Argento's more gaudy creations, but I think that this is intentional. Cinematography it absolutely top-notch, conveying a suitably spooky atmosphere to many scenes. The story is fairly straight-forward for an Argento movie, but not standard fare, and if this had been made by a newcomer it would have been hailed as very solid suspenser indeed. The plot twists and turns even if the outcome isn't too much of a surprise. However, one thing really bothers me about ""Trauma"". The sfx-work by Tom Savini is truly awful. Some scenes, like the one in the elevator-shaft, start creepy enough but are ruined by the effects overall cheesiness (the falling head is only laughable instead of frightening). Shame on you, Savini! Bring on Sergio Stivalletti! Another thing that's not very good is Pino Donaggios score, which he seems to have composed in his sleep. It's not bad, it's just that it seems so routine. Compared to ""Deep red"" and a few others, this is not Argento at his best. But even Argento at half-speed is better and more interesting than most directors produce within a lifetime."

1769,tt0051731,/review/rw1712803/?ref_=tt_urv,"""The Man and the Monster"" is another supreme Mexican horror accomplishment from the vintage late 50's/early 60's era. It's not as brilliant as ""The Black Pit of Dr. M"" or as petrifying as ""The Curse of the Crying Woman"", but nonetheless this movie benefices from a compelling storyline as well as from terrific scenery and devoted acting performances. Reminiscent of the legendary ""Faust"" as well as ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" tales, the script revolves on a middle-aged pianist who sold his soul to the devil (extendedly explained during a fabulously macabre flashback) in order to become the greatest musician in the world. Of course, since all deals with Lucifer soon turn out to be fishy, Samuel quickly discovers his success comes at a high price. Whenever his finest composition of music is played, Samuel transforms into an aggressive werewolf-like monster that can only be tamed by his domineering mother. They conceal corpses in their house and attempt to break the curse by training a gifted female acolyte on the piano, but journalist Ricardo Souto comes close to uncovering the horrific secrets. The continuously uncanny atmosphere of ""The Man and the Monster"" is simply irresistible to avid fans of Gothic horror cinema and, even though many people criticize the make-up effects, I personally thought the monstrous effects were rather acceptable, especially considering the film's year of release. Several sequences are beautifully choreographed and almost artsy, like for example when Samuel literally begs his mother to play the piano and she eventually silently consents by handing him the key to the front door. ""The Man and the Monster"" is a beautiful, enchanting and immensely atmospheric period piece. Perhaps not intended for the nowadays horror-audiences, but undeniably a masterful film."

You should also have the most state of the art surround sound possible, with bass pickups so deep they cause earthquakes on the Eastern seaboard. Not because Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's alien invasion flick is a masterpiece of cinematic art or anything, but because it's loud. Very loud.

On his resume, the director not only has Independence Day, his first dive into the sub-genre, but also Godzilla, The Day After Tomorrow, and 2012, all marked by mass destruction - global most of the time - and a complete absence script or quality performances, absences that open the way for the visual spectacle in computer graphics with several memorable sequences. Here, Independence Day literally encapsulates the spirit of all those similar films from the 70s such as the series Airport, Earthquake, Hell in the Tower, Poseidon's Destiny, copying almost entirely from the classic formula, which usually addresses family nuclei or friends before the tragedy in a slow narrative construction and the consequences after the apocalypse sets in. And there's nothing wrong with that, actually, as Emmerich lends his ability to create epics - Stargate was his immediately preceding film, which already demonstrated his ability to handle science fiction well - and creates a film that will be guaranteed fun. Just ignore the various poetic licenses in the script and embark on the guilt-free adventure."

The acting is decent. Will Smith, with a movie career underway, is excellent. Bill Pullman is great as the President. The effects were amazing especially when the buildings were blown up.

What were they expecting?  A remake of 2001:  A Space Odyssey.  Sure, I am not going to pretend the film does not has many glaring weaknesses.  The plot is hardly original; its execution is even less inspiring.  Roland Emmerich goes out of his way to use every cliche in the book, over-sentimentality, weak, flat characterizations, incredible jumps in logic and reasoning made on the viewer, and the use of special effects to overcome these shortcomings.  But what some of the reviewers seemed to have missed, and its there as substantiated by the huge popularity of the film, is heart. The film has a lot of heart.  It makes you feel good after watching it.  And although that quality does not make it a great film, it certainly makes it a good film in my book.  The film is vastly entertaining, very suspenseful, a delight for the eyes with dazzling special effects, and even has some dialogue that does just rise above its hackneyed origins.  The acting is adequate all around with no one pulling off a great performance, but a few doing marvelous jobs with what they have to work with.  Judd Hirsch easily out acts his fellow colleagues as a Jewish father with a gift for common sense and lack of tact.  Jeff Goldblum also gives a pretty good performance as his son.  Yeah, Will Smith is just Will Smith..lots of one liners and little meat so to speak.  But he is bearable.  Watch for Brent Spiner in an outrageous role as a hippie scientist.  His performance is a real hoot!  If you are looking for philosophical science fiction, this is not it.  See Starship Troopers(a great film).  This is just good old Americans against the universe stuff, lots of action but little substance.

The film depicts the times very well...and most the accents aren't that bad. But the thing i wasn't expecting was to see Cage actually put some effort into his role. Instead of woodenly walking through the film with terrible hair, Cage shows some true emotion and his hair ain't half bad. Cage is hit or miss, sometimes he's good (""Bad Lieutenant""), sometimes he's bad (""The Knowing""). I think Cage gets an A for effort. It's no his best acting but it's an improvement. Pearlman is great as the sidekick/friend and gets most of the good lines. The special effects are kinda lame and the film drags in certain spots, but overall ""Season of the witch"" is a decent thriller with some cheesy dialouge.

1803,tt1815862,/review/rw2807763/?ref_=tt_urv,"This film is not recommended.  Father doesn't always know best, the latest result being After Earth, a  vanity project that Will Smith has concocted for his son, Jaden. This  wobbly sci-fi tale of survival will certainly test both Mr. and Mr.  Smith's star power. Director M. Night Shyamalan, the man who  continually keeps falling from grace, one film after the next, is still  tumbling further from his talented beginnings, although here the  director crashes and burns.   This is not to say that After Earth is hopelessly clichéd, it's just  hopeless. Shymalan's well- made film has some striking imagery, mostly  of panoramic vistas, but his ill-conceived screenplay (co-written with  Gary Whitta) keeps this exercise in filmmaking rather earthbound.  Adding to that, his main star and one of the film's producers, Papa  Smith, pushes nepotism to its limits with this unoriginal dreck. (He is  also given story credit for this silliness.) It's not just that this  film has no Will power, it just has too much of it, both on screen and  off.  Will Smith plays the fearless Cypher Raige, a no-nonsense military  commando sent on a mission with his newt of a son, Kitai, played by  Jaden Smith. Cypher is disappointed with his son's lack of achievement  as a cadet and their relationship is a bit strained, just like the  acting. The Smiths obviously look the part and act the part with the  same stilted delivery. Like father, like son. Unfortunately (for us),  they crash land on the apocalyptic Planet Earth. Cypher is injured with  two broken legs, but pain is not an option. However a better script  would have helped matters. Kitai must now go into rescue mode, wearing  his amazing technicolor space suit, fighting beasts and creatures along  the way to becoming a man.   On his journey of self-awareness, Kitai contends with imminent peril:  giant baboons, poisonous leeches, carnivorous tigers, and such. He  needs to deal with the fluctuating below-freezing temperatures and an  active volcano too. Life is hard. Kitai even battles a monster called  the Ursa, a predator that hunts by sensing fear. (If the creature could  instead sense the smorgasbord of bad acting on its plate, the Ursa  would never go hungry again.) The elder Smith underacts and speaks in  annoying solemn platitudes while the younger Smith overacts in a  squeaky nasal voice that only a teenager can tolerate.   The art direction is mind-numbing. The futuristic sets are bargain  basement knockoffs of Disney World's Tomorrowland, circa 1960...very  unimaginative with an overabundance of Rubbermaid-influenced interiors  and enough flowing linen sheets to make one think that Bed, Bath, and  Beyond had given the filmmakers a cut-rate deal for some product  endorsements. All of the special effects are barely adequate and not  the least bit compelling. After Earth has a strange lethargic  listlessness throughout its short length. The film never builds any  real tension or suspense. It's just so dull and unrelenting in its  stupidity.  After Earth is the type of film that gives the sci-fi genre a bad name.  Shyamalan and the Smiths might want to use other aliases after creating  this debacle. Let's hope they refine their own survival skills when  making another film. After Earth is strictly Ursa Minor.   So dear moviegoers, heed the film's tag-line: ""Danger is real, Fear is  a choice"". You have been sufficiently warned about the real dangers in  viewing After Earth...Fear not, it's still in your control. GRADE: C-"

Of the movies that get a lot of hate The Village was the least bad, not great but pretty decent(while Shyamalan didn't direct but produced and wrote Devil, that also applies here). Signs was pretty good until it went off the boil in the second half, which really brought things down to a significant degree. The others were as bad as I'd heard. Lady in the Water was well-made generally and I liked Bryce Dallas Howard in it as well as the score but the rest was a muddled mess. The Happening and The Last Airbender suffered mainly from having such potential but falling hard big time, Happening did have some unintentional comic value(mainly because Mark Walhberg's acting was so laughably bad) and Airbender had great visuals and score."

Even though it looked a little silly, there were some genuinely creepy moments. So I saw this yesterday and despite all the bad reviews I was really curious to see what this movie was about and to give it a fair chance and may I say that the bad reviews are very justified. Not to say that this is the worst film I have ever seen, but I am getting sick of the ""lost footage"" genre, we know it's all fake so why bother trying to make us believe that it's real? Though the one thing I really give the film credit for is that it tried something different by making it into a documentary type of movie, which was really cool and I loved that it looked at both the scientific and religious side of demonic possession, giving the viewer a reason to question what was real and what was possibly a mental illness. However the slow pace of the creeps and the scares leads into one of the worst endings in movie history."

But Conrad is decent man with Honor and a code of principles that will not let him take part in this sadistic game so he tries his best to survive and get help. Steve Austin does a good job in his first film As lead actor and he's gone on to make better films since his role in the EXPENDABLES is much better and you can see Austin has grown as a actor, This movie is worth checking out if you are a fan of this type of action flick.

The GORES here are also really let down comparing to how much more gleefully bloody and nastier the first film was, but it's still moderately bloody nonetheless. The SCARE here is mostly jumpy one as our Jacob Goodnight here lacks the personality that can deliver the suspense and just looks pathetic instead.

The film's greatest achievement is the coalition of the Justice League members. Their interactions, mannerisms and even their physicality was pretty much on point. Aquaman, although absolutely useless in this, had the physical prowess of a beastly underwater warrior. The Flash was quirky and provided several comedic moments. Cyborg was essentially the technological logistics manager. Wonder Woman and Batman were the parents who lead their children into battle. Heck, she even refers to them as children! Yet it all worked so well. Remember, this is a comic book adaptation, so the humour and light hearted nature of its source material does show. The human CGI for the most part was actually executed well (far better than ""Thor Ragnarok"") and the slow motion scenes with The Flash were gorgeous to watch. Snyder is typically style over substance, which is apparent here. The story is so boringly uninspired that it defines the word ""lazy"". I cannot be dealing with another 'save the world' situation. I'm also becoming irritated with underused, bland and weak villains who are supposed to be absurdly powerful. Steppenwolf was wasted potential. Constant use of green screen, hit and miss script, rushed third act...just too many flaws I'm afraid. Was it too soon for a Justice League film considering no origins for Aquaman, The Flash and Cyborg yet? Personally, I think so."

There isn't much thought put into it. It's like not a part of the Trilogy: Forced and lame jokes, casual and uninspiring score, stereotyped and predictable plot, cheesy and generic writing, undeveloped villain, inappropriate atmosphere, wrong character development... I mean how does one go from this ''Tell me, do you bleed'' to this ''There's something definitely bleeding'' It's like a 'joke'. Who wrote this garbage? I mean why, what was your motive?"

1857,tt3390550,/review/rw3579707/?ref_=tt_urv,"Judging by the recent plenitude of (horror) movies - and even entire TV-series - that are either taking place during OR unmistakably paying tribute to the 1980s, I think it's safe to say that a whole new generation of filmmakers suffer from ""homesickness"" (by lack of a better term) towards the decade in which it was so much easier and more fun to produce and watch horror movies! There's noticeably an immense longing for the good old times when stereotypical characters and clichéd plot lines weren't world-widely criticized on the Internet before the movie got properly released (what Internet?), when dumb teenage protagonists were still getting into physical trouble rather than belittling each other via social media, and when horror victims were still being massacred by killers & monsters with hideous make- up effects rather than by digitalized computer creations. ""The Barn"" obviously also belongs in this trend and, although not as popular or hyped as ""Stranger Things"" or ""The Final Girls"", it's definitely worth checking out for fans of old-school splatter as well as amateurish yet enthusiast low-budget film making. It's almost Halloween in the year 1989, and the 19-year-old but still very immature buddies Sam and Josh are petrifying the neighborhood children and annoying their teacher (cameo of none other than Linnea Quigley). The next day, on their way to a Halloween concert with a few more friends, they stop at a godforsaken barn where according to an ancient local legend three sinister Halloween monsters lie buried. Against the will of firm legend-believer Sam, the group knocks at the door and thus awakens the Boogeyman miner, Hallowed Jack-o-Lantern and Candycorn Scarecrow. The monsters promptly go on a killing spree in the nearby town Helen's Valley, with as gory highlight the extermination of nearly the entire village during the annual Halloween dance. Writer/director Justin Seaman has a lot of heart for the genre and many bright ideas, and therefore you also gladly forgive the lack of style and the many directorial defaults. There are too many overlong dialogues, redundant sequences and questionable performances, but it doesn't matter all that much because this is a full-blooded Halloween feature and highly recommended for the fans. Too many gore-highlights to choose from, including decapitations, eye- gouging, pickax in the head, etc There's also a good soundtrack and – like it was the case in the 80s - even a bit of totally gratuitous nudity."

The action scenes are too short...left me wanting more...it was like there was a build up to each, then they were over in two hits. It really didn't hold my interest, but I did like the idea of the movie, it just needed to be fleshed out a little more.

Mitchell Musolino couldn't carry the lead and the rest of the cast was flat. The writer didn't know what to do with Michelle (Lexi Dripps) and created a sub par character.

This movie is what happens when a bunch of movie stars who just happen to be close friends in real life decide to make a movie just for fun. The plot is simple enough, race from one end of the country to the other for a million dollars and avoid the law on the way. The cast is jammed with big names and just about everyone in the movie that has a speaking part is a star of some stature. This movie is simply great fun and has a lot in common with the rest of director Hal Needham's films,i.e. Smokey and the Bandit. I can't really say that this film is full of great acting because the entire cast horses around through the whole movie. Jackie Chan makes his first appearance in a American movie with this film and both Hal Needham and writer Brock Yates have cameos. Don't expect a lot in the way of plot or acting or effects or anything like that and just enjoy the ride. The outtakes at the end of this and Cannonball Run II are hilarious and it makes it more fun for me anyway to know that this movie was just like a big meeting of old friends. Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. are great as Blake and Fenderbaum respectively. Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluise anchor this film (they're the main characters)and the give and take between these two make them one of the best comedy teams I have ever seen. Bottom Line: Buy this flick, drag it out every once in a while, and have fun watching it with family or friends. A truly fun movie to watch."

Honestly these type of movies are for people who like to laugh and usually don't care how it turns out. I understand some of you may feel if it's a theatrical release then it should be at least worth the money but it's very hard to please everyone when it comes to music and art and it has always come down to a preference thing.

Just as police feel comfortable they've got all the details on the occurances things really get exciting. This movie is directed by Damian Rugna (You Dont Know who You're Talking To) and was made with a fairly limited budget ($367,000). The acting, special effects, cinematography, intensity and gore in this is outstanding. Absolutely phenomenal. There were about 5 scenes that I don't think any director and special effects teams could have done better than how it was portrayed in this film - the opening bathroom scene, the video of the creature crawling out from under the bed (so creepy), the boy's corpse at the table, the police finding the creature under the bed and the hole in the wall scene.

The performances, from the star cast, especially the small kid n the elder sis are grounded and very convincing.
The director's approach to the suspense and horror is slow-building but very very creepy. He shud b given a chance to direct a part of the franchise from the Insidious, Conjuring, Annabelle series. The story is very intriguing. The stark imagery and demonic cutaways were implemented to marvelous effect. Indeed a very scary, spine-tingling n dreadful film.
The interior lighting and shading at the house to some of the daytime n nighttime cemetary exteriors provided some beautiful photography.
The old house with the many rooms, a water well inside its premise n an olden era bathroom all added an eerie feel.
The demons with their umbrella's in the cemetary was top notch scary stuff.

Mark-Paul Gosselaar, the Michelangelo of Thieves apparently, acts with the kind of confidence only a guy who thinks Wakeboarding is an extreme sport would. And did I mention every girlfriend is a sniper? Granted, no adults were involved in the making of 'Precious Cargo', or it wouldn't have been made at all.

It was a simple yet good story and a good piece of science fiction. Why was it a good film? Well, for starters, the bad guy, i.e the terminator, according to Kyle Reese, doesn't feel pain or pity, can't be reasoned with, can't be bargained with. It was the perfect killer, and almost invincible. So there you got all the elements of a good story."

For years my friends and I would toss around the line, ""I can grow a new claw--can you grow a new life?"" I recently purchased a copy on the Internet and had a chance to watch it again. Except for the conventional bumbling around that characters in this kind of movie do (wandering in the dark in the middle of the night; responding to amplified voices as they lie in their beds in fear; going alone through caves where there is only one exit and the crabs are definitely around) this is pretty entertaining. I'm not sure whether these crabs have world domination in mind (revenge for those little forks and drawn butter) or just want to rid the island of humans. They do a real number on the eco-system. Will they have any beaches left to go to. Will they eventually go back to being ""just crabs"" or will they take their ventriloquist act on the road? We really don't know."

Corman's usual stock company does very well here.  Mel Welles and Leslie Bradley sport believeable accents, Richard Garland and Pamela Duncan (both of whom would be in THE UNDEAD the same year) are a fine couple, Russell Johnson is great and Beech Dickerson is the comedy relief.  If we can believe Ed Nelson, he is the one who was under the giant crab and he also dimly recalled Jack Nicholson hanging around the location pestering Roger for something to do so maybe Jack was helping move the crab around too. Gore is non existant (it was 1957 for cryin' out loud!) except for a decapitation at the start of the film (interestingly (symbolically?) the victim is Charles Griffith who wrote the screenplay). Can I get serious for a moment now?  Would someone get in touch with Roger and get him to round up the cast members who are still alive and release this on DVD with an audio commentary track?  There IS a market for this movie out there and a 45th anniversary edition would, in my opinion, sell very well.

Times change, computer generated effects are ""in"" and we sometimes forget that people like Willis O'Brien were pioneers in the fx field, working with little but their imagination and creativity. So enjoy this typical 50's Big Bug entry for what it is. I have seen it a number of times and have a little soft spot in my heart (not my head!) for it. It is full of those actors that were popping up all the time during the 50's as second leads or in ""B"" films. The cavern scene with the worms and scorpions is pretty damn good but that little brat Juanito needed to be scorpion bait from the beginning! Probably the funniest thing in the film is the reaction of the military men in the stadium when one of their own gets electrocuted because someone forgot to turn off the power....they just blow it off and go on.

Rather than giving you my own two cents (well, I WILL give you those, but later), I would like to let the people directly involved in The Meg share their - refreshingly honest - thoughts on it, because they had some very interesting things to say that helped me better understand what I'd just seen. Let's start with Jason Statham's recent interview with Frosty Weintraub. You'll notice Jason tries to be diplomatic, but he has a very hard time concealing the fact that he's not too happy with the finished product:"

I don't know if it is me, but I found the music really really annoying and unfit, thus making me really uncomfortable in the moments where the movie was supposed to be comfortable... I could almost guarantee absolute boredom for about most of half the film. First half is just... plain uninteresting, and when things finally happen to happen, it gets pretty better but in absolutely no way makes up for the indifference it creates... you're already bored of the characters, and you just don't care for them... (In fact, I found Michelle the only likable character, but maybe cause she gets not much screen in the first half and the pretty good acting). As I stated in the summary, it could have been good but the movie suffers from ,not many, but really bad choices."
1930,tt0823726,/review/rw1999689/?ref_=tt_urv,"I had no idea what I was going to get when I rented LA LLORONA or THE WAILER in English. It deals with a Mexican legend that I've heard very little of, about a woman who drowns her two children in order to have the love of the man she wants. After being rejected by this man, she kills herself. Fast forward in the movie and we have an assortment of horror movie clichés that would be worth mentioning to a film class in order to avoid them! You have the sexy teens looking for a good time, going to a lonely cabin in the woods of Jalisco, in the middle of nowhere, the mandatory bad acting, the explicit (albeit, cheap looking) gore and your mandatory tit scene. In all honesty, the premise of this so called ""film"" holds promise. It could've been a decent horror movie in the hands of a more skilled director, but this is strictly ""amateur"" hour. "

I have to agree with a lot of the things the first viewer that posted thought of this movie. I've been a huge fan of this old Mexican legend and always thought it was creepy and hair raising. I live in Laredo, which is a border town to Mexico, and in between is the Rio Grande, so I've heard plenty of stories about La Llorona. There's plenty of versions about her legend but this one nails the more commonly heard version. I'm gonna give you the positives and negatives of this film so here goes:"

Perkins really goes off as the respected scientist, who unleashes his inner self through experiments with the new drug, cocaine. He even somehow, apparently creates some sort of Crack, that can be lit with a wooden fireplace match!?! Production values are surprisingly high! Like a friend of mine said, I could almost buy into the idea, that Jack The Ripper was a sexually frustrated scientist experimenting with new drugs. Lush, often restrained, but also often quite gory. Probably more in tune with 70's arty euro-porn, than the history of horror films, this is often quite disturbing, and Perkins is at his best. Almost assured of a better reputation as time goes on.

Intriguing take on the over-played Jekyll and Hyde story with some twists and turns thrown in to keep the viewer interested. Also an excellent performance from Glynis Barber as Mrs.Jekyll.

This only has one of those in Taraji P Henson, who is not only game for this kind of movie but has done the training necessary for a character who kills a lot of people with guns and some fight choreography.

For that reason I was expecting a lot of special effects and explosions and didn't think he was the director that should be in charge of this story. I'm not ashamed to admit that I was wrong. This is a realistic war movie that doesn't embellish the drama or actions, mainly because the story didn't need it. The movie is not political at all and mainly focus on the soldiers decisions.

Before its 1992 theatrical release, I remember the film being heavily hyped as Stephen King's first foray into cinema with a completely original screenplay (and as was true with most adaptations of his work--with or without his involvement--at the time, the reviews were less than sympathetic). Ironically, Garris would become better known for helming TV-miniseries versions of some of King's best-known works (""The Stand""; ""The Shining""; ""Desperation""), directing right from the author's own scripts. Needless to say, these made-for-TV works outshine ""Sleepwalkers,"" which simply further proves that King's writing style (heavy with internal dialogues and detailed, unspoken perceptions) is better suited to a format that can fully develop his themes and characters. This tale of an incestuous mother/son duo who shapeshifts into bloodthirsty felines, roaming from small towns to dine on virgin prey, is fairly decent for the first 50 minutes--King's use of 'local color' (and the resulting humor) is well-rendered, and Garris does a fine job of creating an atmosphere of mystery and intrigue. But just when ""Sleepwalkers"" seems headed for the zone of good (if not truly memorable) King adaptations, its final third devolves into overblown, ridiculous action sequences (as though the producers chopped away 30 pages of King's script for explosions and shootouts) and a queasy imbalance between absurd humor and sentimental melodrama. The end result hobbles the overall experience--had King's ideas been thoroughly fleshed-out, ""Sleepwalkers"" may have been a solid entry in his filmography...but as it stands, it feels like a lament over what could have been. The cats are incredibly cute, though."

The acting in this feature is purely amazing and the storyline may not be the most original but writers have creative privilege and they can always refresh our memories if they so choose. And although ""The Devil's Doorway"" does have 2 or 3 jump scares over the limit the dialogue keeps you entertained while you wait for the actual occurrences to take place and yes regardless of what the advertising banner for this movie says this is found footage and it's a pretty darn good one. The camera has a few jiggly moments at the end of the movie but 95% of it was was steady and well angled. Special effects were decent and the camera editing was converted into the look of a retro 35mm camera giving it a boost of realism. All in all this movie definitely fits the bill of a good horror flick so I give it an 8 which means you surely won't be mad to sit down and check this one out when you get a chance."

You sort of know what is happening, but you still want to see it to the end. Very scary, a few minor jump scares, and one or two major ones. Ghoulish, hellish, and pure evil.

Johnny Mnemonic is a 1995 American cyberpunk sci-fi action film directed by Robert Longo. It was loosely based on the short story ""Johnny Mnemonic"" by William Gibson.Keanu Reeves plays the title character, a man with a cybernetic brain implant designed to store information. The film portrays Gibson's dystopia view of the future with the world dominated by mega corporations and with strong East Asian influences. Seriously this movie kicks ass. Keanu Reeves and Dina Meyer are awesome. I love when An assassin try's to kill Johnny he aim his gun on his back and says ""Time to die"" and Johnny says ""Time"" and he switch's his watch and the bomb explodes. Dina Meyer as body guard Jane throws a grenade and kills a few assassins. Dina Meyer also co started in her latest movie in the 90's Starship Troopers unfortunately her character in that movie was killed. I really love Dolph Lundgren as Street Preacher ""It's Jesus time!"" ""HALT SINNERS!"" Dolph shows up after next 45.mins. in the movie I wish he would have showed earlier. He's acting is still pretty good. Ice-T and Udo Kier did a great performance in their roles. "

Sometimes more. There's just something about it that I like. Well, lets start from the beginning:"
1980,tt0113481,/review/rw0365146/?ref_=tt_urv,"Johnny Mnemonic could have been a wonderful movie, had William Gibson not strayed so far from his original story when writing the screenplay.  Having painter Robert Longo direct the movie, the first and to this date only full length feature he has directed, was probably not the best idea either. While Longo may present the occasional intriguing image, his inexperience shows in other areas.  The acting is terrible for the most part, with Henry Rollins taking the cake for worst performance.  Reeves, contrary to popular opinion, is alright and has a few great scenes, most notably his angry breakdown on the pile of garbage under the bridge."

Massive re-shoots (rumored up to 75% of the movie), recasts, rewrites, over a year of delays, basically any and everything that could possibly go wrong.

I like his last works in this genre (""Scream 1, 2 & 3"") and also the drama ""Music of the Heart"", and Christina Ricci is very cool. Unfortunately, ""Cursed"" is a forgettable and predictable collection of clichés. It is amazing how the viewer can predict the next scene! Further, it is amazing how easy is to replace a fancy car in Hollywood: Ellie wrecks her car in the middle of the night, and on the next day she has a brandy new car. Jake breaks the window of the driver of the new car, and on the next sequence we see Ellie driving in a rainy night in high speed without disheveling her hair. Ellie's brother Jimmy unsuccessfully tries to be funny. If you want to see a great werewolf movie, there are many excellent options, but you can forget ""Cursed"", which is only recommended for killing time. My vote is five."

It's kind of a family tragedy, mixed in with elements of Stranger things. In spite of that I really rather liked it, it has a bit of originality, it has plenty of expectation, albeit those expectations aren't fully realised, but has some very well rounded characters. The horror elements when they come are fairly minor, but the gas visual works well. For me this is a film that deals with grief more then anything."

The Sci Fi Network has some real need of new creative staff, writers and directors. This was a poorly done venture of a pitiful film. While I enjoyed seeing Colm Meaney (Vincent) and Christopher Atkins (John Palmer) again, even their acting was rather bleak. The plot was interesting, but overdone - huge mutant beetles living underground for who knows how long. While the bugs themselves looked 'real', the editing was painful! There were really bad clips during the entire movie. Pay attention to a scene early in the movie when the group is going down the mine shaft  one guy nearly falls out  watch the 'skillful' editing when they get him back on the lift! Amateur film makers with Hi-8 Video Cameras could have probably done a better job. What was up with the actors who played the kids? Chelan Simmons (Emily Palmer) and Stevie Mitchell (Miles Palmer) were real screamers! I had to check the cast list to make sure that the actress who played Emily wasn't the daughter of Kate Capshaw! (Remember all the shrill, needless screaming she did in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom). All Chelan/Emily did was scream nearly the entire movie. If the writers were more realistic, the character of Emily would have been more of a fighter and helped her mother, Samantha (played by Angela Featherstone). At one point, I hoped Samantha would just shoot Emily to shut her up. I love the Sci Fi Channel because I really love Science Fiction and Adventure films, but the bigwigs in that network need a reality check and clean house of those who are producing their network movies. Most Sci Fi Channel/Network 'Original' movies have been absolutely horrible. Why do I even try to watch their 'Original' movies? Because I do live this type of movie and want to give them a chance and...I must also be a glutton for punishment...I keep expecting that they will finally get with the right picture."

Tough DEA agent Carlos Seguin (a solid and engaging performance by Erik Estrada) discovers that the grisly murders are being committed by a pack of chupacabras, which are lethal predatory creatures of local legend. Director Terry Ingram, working from a blithely absurd script by Terry Sullivan, relates the enjoyably inane story at a snappy pace, treats the gloriously ludicrous premise with gut-busting seriousness, and delivers oodles of graphic gore (throats are torn out, stomachs are ripped open, and one poor guy even has his penis bitten off!). The hilariously hokey CGI monsters -- they look like giant mutant emaciated Chihuahuas! -- and the uproariously unconvincing scenes of an aged Estrada ""riding"" a motorcycle that were done with obvious green screen work add immensely to this film's considerable campy charm. The sincere acting by the game cast helps a whole lot: Julia Benson as Carlos' feisty new partner Tracy Taylor, Jorge Vargas as Carlos' wayward estranged son Tommy, Vanesa Tomasino as the eager Agent Dani, Nicole Munoz as Carlos' rebellious teenage daughter Sienna, Chad Krowchuk as goofy tour guide Crockett, and Brent McLaren as rowdy gang banger Loco. Anthony C. Metchie's sharp cinematography boasts some atmospheric lighting and several gnarly chupacabra POV shots. Stu Goldberg's thrilling twangy'n'tuneful hits the stirring spot.

I'm not going to compare it with the first one because it doesn't matter. The story itself might be completely ridiculous but then again for this movie to work it has to be completely ridiculous. It's more about the mimics, the clothing, and the way of acting. I thought the whole cast did a very good job. Ben Stiller is just a funny guy. Everything he does is just funny. As well as Will Ferrell. But if you in general don't like those actors you should just not watch their movies because you know what you get with them. To all the haters I can just say stop watching their movies because it will always be the same humor. Ridiculous or not, it doesn't matter, because for some people it's entertainment and it makes them have a good time laughing.

The script is witty, funny and pretty much laugh a minute and the gags and spoofs are mostly dead on, my favourite being the one with GhostFace and Shorty getting high.

Further, when I see this type of movie, I know exactly what I am going to see: scatological jokes, funny and surrealistic situations and definitely a movie that will never be indicated for an Oscar. I found this 'Scary Movie 3' very funny. It satirizes mainly 'The Ring', followed by 'Signs', and part of '8 Miles' and one of these last two 'The Matrix' sequences. The last scene is a joke with 'Final Destination'. This is the type of movie that you must shut down your brain and start laughing. There are two scenes that I liked very much: when the moron George (Simon Rex) is in a club for Afro-Americans, wins the rap competition and covers his head with the hood of his coat. The other one, when Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) uses her laptop and many screens pops-up. In many sites, even in IMDb, there are some pops-up screens that irritate me. What I do not understand is some comments of persons that should never watch this type of movie. What do they expect to see when they go to the movie theaters or buy / rent a DVD of 'Scary Movie 3', directed by David Zucker and with Leslie Nielsen in the cast? An art movie, with hidden messages, an epic, a classic or a film with politically correct jokes? Honestly, if I did not like this genre, I would never spend my time watching it. My vote is seven."

It begins with a spoof of the first scene from The Ring, then cuts to Tom's (Charlie Sheen) discovery of the crop circles on his farm ala Signs. As a bridge between the stories, Cindy Campbell (Anna Farris) is a television news reporter who is doing a story on the crop circles, and who is the guardian of a young psychic boy, Cody (Drew Mikuska), similar to Aidan of The Ring. The two stories turn out to be intimately connected. Tom's brother, George (Simon Rex) is a white rapper, ala Eminem in 8 Mile, and he strikes up a romance with Campbell.

All they did was badly repeating what had worked in the first movie and that is something that should be avoided at all time.

It's a very simple plot, but it has a certain style and intensity that make up for that lack of complexity.

Of course, many independent films comprise and follow similar themes; However, this one further raises the bar with its incredibly bleak depiction of sheer hopelessness as experienced by our protagonist and those around him.

There have been, however, some decent adaptations like Mortal Kombat (the first film, not the sequel) and the Resident Evil films. Now that I've viewed the unrated version, DOOM can be added to that list. Although not nearly as stylish and entertaining as Mortal Kombat or Resident Evil, DOOM may not be the mind-blowing spectacle that fans of the video game were hoping for, but at least it knows what it is: a fun ALIENS knock-off. Unlike ALIENS, Doom lacks a strong story and well-developed characters that the audience can cheer for. The characters here are barely one dimensional. They are given essentially no motivation for what they do and as a result, the movie suffers.

Fairly effective chiller with Olsen as a young woman in a sort of homecoming who is helping her father get a piece of real estate ready for an impending sale and finds herself trapped when a home invasion occurs (or does it?) The real-time one-take gimmick employed by intrepid married filmmakers Chris Kentis and Laura Lau (who adapted from a film by Gustavo Hernandez) is rather smoothly transferred with impeccable camera-work by Igor Martinvoic yet the premise taxes the nerves (and not in the way it should i.e. gooseflesh/hair-on-end spookiness) by the story's (anti)climax that upends psychological horror instead of its ghost-story approach of things-that-bump-in-the-night in spite of its leading lady's full-on embodiment to a finely tuned pitch of believable angst and genuine terror."

This movie can only do harm to people who get offended easily at racial stereotypes, pot smoking and more pot smoking. The movie pokes fun at everyone; class and race. One glance at How High would make you think they're trying to make another ""Animal House"". Well, I think it's up there. It's got everything except the fraternities. From childish pranks to goofy humor, Meth and Red carry the movie to its predictable conclusion. Many people will write this off as another ""Black comedy"", but it really is a comedy for everyone. It just ""happens"" to star two charismatic rap artists. Director Jesse Dylan (yes, Bob's son) knows how to set up a joke and pull the punchline. This film is far funnier than the last two ""Friday"" films combined (Yes, let's just compare it to other pothead comedies).  The supporting cast is terrific as well, including the clueless Fred Willard and uptight Obba Babatunde. The only downside is Mike Epps' pimp character, done much better by Eddie Griffin in ""Deuce Bigalow."" "

There is something about marijuana used in comedies that makes the comedy better, though it depends on if the jokes are delivered right and with the right zing.  Cheech and Chong had that to a T and comedies like Half Baked and Friday got pretty close to that tradition, as does this movie which is surprising since this is Method Man and Redman's first comedy together and is co-produced by Danny DeVito."

So, don't see it with the same eyes you could have for a Marty Scorcese's movie. Please. The most interesting for me is of course JCVD performance, because he has here the bad guy character, and he is shown, he fights as if he was the good one. The true heroes of this feature are nearly transparent, and the film focuses on JCVD the heavy dude. Don't you find this interesting and so unusual?

Once it gets going, it doesn't slow down at all. It almost goes by too fast since it's only 85 minutes. Something I was kind of surprised with was how much JC was actually in it. I mean, this felt like a Van Damme movie! Not just a minute of screen time here and there. He 100% felt like the lead to me. I didn't mind Tom Everett Scott at all. Yeah, his character was a bit of a pussy and he isn't the first actor you would think of for an action role but it was just nice seeing a familiar Hollywood face...and acting wise, I thought he was fine. I would take him as a co star any day of the week over a Randy Couture type. Same goes for Orlando Jones.

Visually the film is incredible. It's unlike anything you've ever seen. The fighting is quick, furious and the story although not completely involving is involving enough so that we kinda like the characters.

It has a very interesting A story that could have made a great film, but The White Storm spends a lot of the 134-minute running time telling instead of showing its story.

In a movie like this, the producers don't pay expensive actors to act or to create realistic performances or to use their talents to win our sympathy. No, they pay these actors for face and name recognition, so when a movie like Ballistic: Banderas vs Liu comes along we don't have the inconvenience of learning about characters and plot.

The actual fight scenes in Kiss of the Dragon may have been better, due to the fact little to no CGI's were used, but The One is a much better movie overall.  What makes this movie work even more is the great selection of music.  How can it get better than seeing Jet Li kick the not out of people while Drowning Pool's ""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"" is playing in the background?  Other artists in the movie include Disturbed, and Papa Roach so you can get a pretty good idea of what the fight scenes are like.

Alone in the Dark is a film by director Uwe Boll, whose film right before this one was House of the Dead (2003). Like Alone in the Dark, it was also a film adaptation of a video game. Almost everyone hated it. Well, I loved it. I even gave it a 10 out of 10!

There are no characters, just a few stereotypes wandering around and getting killed. The extent of the character development was giving each character a name and an occupation, and that's about it. There was no real plot, and none of the characters seemed to have any motivation. In fact, many action scenes just began on their own, coming from nowhere with a pounding techno track. While I was watching this movie I kept asking ""Where is this happening? What's going on?"" The acting was high school drama quality, with stiff wooden delivery, as though the actors were reading from cue cards without comprehending their lines. Their trouble delivering lines was made even more obvious by horrible sound design. ADR sounded like it was recorded in an open room. The actors were constantly taking obvious care to hit their marks, looking almost robotic in their movements. So, these listless automatons are whisked through a series of implausible and confusing scenarios, often without even the benefit of transition scenes. They were here, now they're there.

The 'monsters' were the unemployed worm from Star Trek 2, The Wrath of Khan, and rejected designs for the space creatures in Alien. The creators of the movie obviously didn't want to overshadow the third rate movie monsters, so they hired forth rate actors who apparently didn't get to memorize their lines, or in some cases learn to pronounce the words before filming began. Some scenes are incredibly inept in conveying just what is supposed to be happening, if anything is. If you are unfortunate enough to be in a theater where this movie is showing, and you don't pass out, you'll laugh at what are supposed to be frightening or suspenseful moments of the film. The implausibility of several scenes will just stun you, and Stephen Dorff's regular spewing of the 'Queen Mary of curse words' conveys the feeling of anyone who pays to see this.

One of these is that it's based on a short story by one of the hallmark authors of science fiction, Philip K Dick, and another is that the script mostly got work done (and seems most noticeable) by Dan O'Bannon, writer behind Alien and Return of the Living Dead. There's more weight in levels of irony, not always the uproarious variety but more nuanced and violent, more in putting some good twists to the clichés that are taken for granted in stories set in desolate futuristic environments (the discovery of a cute abandoned child, the devilish nature of the 'screamers' themselves and how their more advanced counterparts work, the personalities of the crew that Peter Weller's character discovers at the base, and how each member soon dies/gets killed off). This might also be attributable to O'Bannon, who tackled this in his previous successes in films, but to say who is totally responsible for what can only be said for those who've read Dick's story Second Variety, which I have not. However it should be said, if only on some level of understanding from reading past works of his, it feels like it has a level of faith to the source, albeit changing locations and certain details in the situations, by being approximately cynical to the characters."

The part they messed up though, and why this is such a bland experience, was they just didn't give her anything interesting to do. "

Yes, both movies (Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life)) are far from perfect but at least they tried to capture the spirit of the games - character- and story-wise. Alicia Vikander may be a good looking woman and a decent actor but she is in no way Lara Croft (that ""modernized"" Lara is just plain terrible). Anyway, as most movie adaptions of games are rather total fails or subpar, both Tomb Raider movies starring Angelina are solid adventure and action food."

1. A.J. put in a lot of training to perform the Croft action sequences as authentically as possible.
2. The sets were fantastic w/less CGI than we see now. 
3. The actual filming sites (Cambodia; Iceland) were a gift in themselves. 
4. The usual ancient guardians coming to life were well done and not stereotypic. 
5. Slightly prefer the A.J. interpretation over the new Vikander rendition, but they both did as well as expected given the challenges. Also preferred this version's script over the 2018 script. 
Negatives: 
1. The puzzle solving in the game was much more challenging than the all to common & typical movie weird little rotating disk antiquity device combined w/rotating circular door. 
2. The (what was then nine) planets lining up - not going to happen, and they don't produce a solar eclipse - you only need the moon to do that. 
3. The good guy, bad guy plot makes movies but would have liked a more creative action challenge.

2135,tt0070300,/review/rw1130868/?ref_=tt_urv,"This highlight of seventies horror cinema is a vibrant and lush Gothic fairytale story of a young girl's odyssey as she searches for her father in a world of vampires and demons that wont hesitate to take her innocence at any opportunity that they get. Richard Blackburn's film takes influence from a number of sources across both film and literature, but in spite of this; the writer-director has managed to mould together a tale that is both haunting and original. The story follows Lila Lee, the daughter of a notorious gangster who, after finding his wife in bed with another man, proceeds in blowing both her and her lover to bits. Shortly after her father had fled the town to avoid the law, Lila Lee receives a letter telling her that her father is on his deathbed and wants her to come and see him. Only thing is, this letter is signed 'Lemora'. The film plays out like an offbeat coming of age drama, with the innocent young Lila Lee learning that all is not as it seems, and that danger lurks around every corner. The supernatural elements serve brilliantly as a metaphor for the similar dangers in real life."
2136,tt0070300,/review/rw1084532/?ref_=tt_urv,"Modern audiences may be a little put off by this movie at first glance - just on account of its fairly low production values - but it's definitely superior to most films of its kind, although it's such a unique oddity it's hard to compare it with anything else. Lemora plays more like a dark fairy tale than a horror movie and I actually found it to be thoughtful and moving when I watched it through to the end. Atmosphere, a great story, and a likable and sympathetic protagonist are what make this movie work. "
2137,tt0070300,/review/rw1183818/?ref_=tt_urv,"A dark, atmospheric little film, it is quite bizarre and intriguing to watch, with shadow enhancing lighting, flashy colours, great sets, and a fine lead performance by Cheryl Smith, who is a perfect choice to play an innocent uncorrupted. On the other hand, the writer-director gives off a somewhat restrained performance as a priest, and towards the end, the film heads off into rather messy territory, with excesses of horror and too many slow motion, plus it takes forever to wrap the story up. There are some interesting ideas at hand, and a few worthwhile production elements, but overall this is a film that is much more so interesting than it is great."

2139,tt0089122,/review/rw1871641/?ref_=tt_urv,"I had two movies called ""Fair Game"" standing on my must-see list, so I watched them after each other in order not to lose track of one of them. The first one was an obscure Italian lethal-snake-on-the-loose thriller also known as ""Mamba"" and this one is Australia's belated (unless I missed something) response to the 'Revengeploitation"" sub genre. Revenge thrillers were especially popular throughout the entire decade of the 70's, with highlights like ""Last House on the Left"", ""I Spit on your Grave, ""Fight for your Life"", ""House by the Lake"" and ""House on the Edge of the Park"". These movies routinely handle about innocent women (preferably defenseless and fragile) getting harassed and viciously raped by a group of men (preferably perverted hicks and/or fugitive criminals) and then avenging themselves by taking justice into their own hands. The gritty atmosphere and gratuitous use of violence and sleaze in ""Fair Game"" is pretty much prototypic revenge thriller stuff, but it nevertheless also remains an authentic Aussie movie, meaning the assaulters are bored kangaroo poachers looking for new thrills and the 'victim' (Cassandra Delaney; the former Mrs. John Denver) is actually a very potent lady who fights back from the beginning and never really allows her opponents to get the upper hand. Jessica runs a wildlife reservation in the middle of the outback, so naturally there's a vicious conflict when she bumps into a trio of insensitive and macho poachers doing some illegal kangaroo hunting on her territories. This film feels refreshing and innovative because the script doesn't unfold like the majority of 70's revenge thrillers. The interactions between Jessica and the poachers start off like a testosterone-laden showdown, but then gradually escalate into a merciless battle with humiliation, rape and murder. There are several highly memorable and deliciously exploitative scenes in ""Fair Game"", most notably the one with Delaney  in her white undies - tied to the hood of a jeep whilst it races through the desert. Her acts of vengeance during the climax are quite impressive as well and I guarantee there's some impressive bloodshed to enjoy in ""Fair Game"". As often the case with Australian cult-productions (""Outback"", ""Wolf Creek"", ""Mad Max""), the exterior filming location and wildlife images alone make the movie worth purchasing and this particular one also benefices from good music and stylish camera-work. The acting performances are more than satisfying and I'm pleased to notice the cast exclusively exists of native Australians. This isn't always the case, you know. Definitely recommended if you're a fan of the revenge movies."
2140,tt0089122,/review/rw1949323/?ref_=tt_urv,"This mid-eighties thriller is a skimpy, but surely entertaining and crazy Australian b-grade exploitation attempt at the revenge sub-genre. A young woman takes on some restless kangaroo poachers who go onto make her life hell, when she confronts them about killing animals on her wildlife sanctuary. It's a lot better than you're led to believe. A cat (well there's three of them) and mouse game evolves, as they simply go tit for tat (no one is desperate to back down) in humiliating, terrorising and finally gaining sweet vengeance. The savage violence isn't particularly extreme, as it has a comic book tone to it, but it's mean-spirited and gustily dished-up. From the get-go you can tell it's going to be thrilling, exciting and blistering as it gets straight in to it and never adjusts otherwise. The suspense holds up and the adrenaline kick gets the heart-pounding in many knuckle-busting sequences (the memorable trophy truck ride). Andrew Lesnie sharply photographs the colourfully rugged Australian landscape and wildlife, but it's the moody nightlife cinematography that adds the atmospheric dynamics. Cassandra Delaney (who looks lovely and spends the quite bit time in the flesh) brings a genuine grittiness and sympathetic side to a strong, capable character. The boneheaded, cruel poachers are eccentrically portrayed by Peter Ford, David Sandford and Gary Who. From this inclusion, the gigantic killer pig feature 'Razorback (1984)' comes to mind. Dominating a lot the scenes would be that of Ashley Irwin's uncanny live-wire and throbbing music score. Sometimes uncalled for, but always palatable. Director Mario Andreacchio makes good of the psychical set-pieces and locations. While writer Rob George's material is fundamental, he still strikes up a dependable script that never resorts to camping it up. An agreeable revenge item."

I enjoyed the rural Australian scenery; that was interesting to me; the remoteness helped give some credibility to the lawless villains. The setting was different and remote, giving some credibility to the lawlessness of the villains. A lot of the action was unique and haunting. The plot grew more and more predictable but I didn't mind. The plot seemed designed to showcase Cassandra's charms and, I confess, she won me over! Unfortunately, Casasandra later married John Denver in real life and turned to music...meaning she was only in about 5 movies. Too bad. I would go to a movie just to see her."

Still, he's able to give it all that he's got like in his previous films, and it's nice seeing that he went down still a tough guy. The rest of the movie proves to be just as surprisingly enjoyable. It does go on too long (125 minutes!), and there is not as much action as you may be expecting. But the drama portion of the movie proves to be compelling, and the few action scenes there are turn out to be exceedingly well done. Certainly no masterpiece, but it is entertaining. Fans of Norris and/or Marvin, however, should be warned that the two of them don't appear in as much of the movie as they may be expecting."

The music is tense and the performances are solid (especially Robert Forster as the head terrorist).  Then, when Chuck and Lee show up, the film turns into a patriotic cheesefest where the delta force whips out the terrorists along to cheesy 80s patriotic pop music.  The film definitely goes down from here. The director should've realized that the first half was tense and realistic and decided to keep it that way, even if they were going to have the delta force take out the terrorists.  I really dont know why they changed the mood of the film so much, because if they had'nt, this could've been an excellent actioner.  The second half is still somewhat enjoyable and very unintentionally funny, but those who think that the second half of the film would be as gripping as the first will be disappointed. 3/5"

It not only stands over, but towers above many of its kin (some of which are also about large, flesh-eating lizards from Indonesia) with higher production values, a mostly excellent cast, and more of the creative magic that we love the movies for.

The special effects are in fact pretty impressive for a straight to video cheesefest, and the cinematography is definitely worth noting. The cinematographer somehow made Komodo look like a big budget studio piece, with some very inventive camera angles and my favorite... a LOT of movement. I don't know why...

If there weren't so many shots of the background scenery that tied in with the game (although they were never fully or, in some cases, partially explored), I would assume that no one involved in the movie had even seen cut scenes from the game. I would have assumed that they got a one paragraph synopsis on the game, with character names, and just made up their own story that barely connected to the game storyline."

A chilling and surprisingly realistic tale of reality TV gone mad. It may have been far-fetched back then but not so now. Not when you think about it. Currently, Reality TV shows are either scraping the bottom of the barrel or desperate to raise the bar. If the next one isn't more controversial as the last, it's a dud. How long will it be before we really do see shows like The Running Man? How long before we have 'court-appointed theatrical attorneys' or the entertainment division of the Justice Department? There is so much satire and intelligence in this movie that may have been missed back in 1987 that is desperate to be seen again considering the current state of TV shows."

It was one of those movies that didn't interest me enough to see it when it was out in theatres. When I first saw it I thought it was fun and entertaining but too far fetched and too much gory violence. Its scary to watch it 32 years later and see how much has closer to home it hits now. An Alexa type system turns on TV and other appliances. The world economy has collapsed (Greece and other EU nations have faced similar economic crises in recent years) there are food shortages (Venezuela, the native country of Maria Conchita Alonso have empty grocery store shelves and unrest because of mass starvation). The U.S. government and the entertainment industry work in concert to keep the populace distracted by a savage reality TV show called The Running Man. Enemies of the state have no trial by jury they are merely turned over to the ruthless, scuzzy host of the show, played by Richard Dawson. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a member of the military who is railroaded by the State into participating on the show. (Keep in mind Reality TV wasnt even a concept until almost 15 years after this movie was made.) The Running Man is the #1 show on television with people caring more about the deadly cat and mouse game with the hunted actually being brutally killed on live TV with an enthusiastic studio audience cheering it on. (A chilling reminder of the desensitization of the culture in our current age of social media.) No interest in the constitution, freedom or human rights...free board games and household gadgets given away by Dawson to the audience is a much bigger draw. The movie even predicts millennial ignorance of classic TV (Gilligan's Island, is that the one with the boat? Who's Mr. Spock?)"

The Running Man has a premise that was later used by Battle Royale and The Hunger Games and easily stands along other dystopias from films of the era like Escape From New York and Robocop. It was violent, cheesy and had lots of Arnie one-liners. The Running Man was meant to be a satire about game shows but it's satire is more prescient now with the world of reality TV, 24 hour TV, and deep fakes."

However, I have to ask- did the other reviewers even READ the book?? Lets be honest people- it's almost impossible to make a movie that follows the book exactly, word for word. It would be a 12 hour film! In my opinion, and this is stated from someone who has read the book numerous times, the movie Timeline does a good job picking up the highlights of the book, keeping as close to possible to the original story. Some of the mumbo-jumbo technical stuff is glossed over in the film, and I praise the screenwriters for that, as adding it would have made a confusing, boring mess to the movie. One of the greatest parts about Hollywood is the use of creative license. Yes, the film uses this during spots, but NOT enough to detract from the book plot. Yes,the acting is definitely not the greatest (with maybe the exception of Matt Craven), but again, NOT enough to detract from the book plot. This film takes what the readers loved about the book and changes very little. I could easily correlate the two. And I challenge the negative reviewers to find me a movie that doesn't change some parts of the book it is based upon. If you like the book, give the movie a chance."

Gerard Butler on the other hand might be one good thing in the whole film. The multiverse-travel scene is a total disaster.

I read some of these in-depth critiques in utter amazement. I mean, really, what were you expecting to see? It is a very light hearted spoof of one of the most ridiculous TV series in history. Generally, I thought it was funny, we've been repeating some of the funnier, albeit, totally ridiculous scenes all day. I do strongly caution parents with children.

Just like Dan Aykroyd's big budget sci-fi adventure comedy ""Coneheads"" from 1993 this fantasy film felt like that did.

I can tell you he was in Stripes and he was one of the punks in Terminator and he even had a small role in Commando.  His three best films in my opinion are True Lies, Aliens and his classic turn as Chet in Weird Science.  Anyone that has seen this film will tell you that they loved it when Chet comes home to find it snowing in his room.  Or how fun it was to watch him torture Wyatt by extorting money from him.  ""For Christ sakes Wyatt will you cover yourself! ""  Bill Paxton may be best known for his work in James Cameron films but it is John Hughes that we have to thank for unleashing him onto audiences with this amazing turn as Chet Donnelly.  He is the meanest, nastiest older brother and yet he is screamingly funny.  Bill Paxton had a cameo in a film called The Last Supper years later and his character really could have been a grown up Chet.  But it is here that we get to laugh at some of Paxton's best work.

It's obvious that the budget was low and bearing that in mind I think the overall result wasn't that bad at all. The acting was fairly sound, Jack Coleman, Holly Elissa and Terry Mulligan were convincing in their respective roles - and I think one reviewers 'apology' for Canada producing such a rubbish film was both unnecessary and over-the-top. The subject matter about shifting Poles causing Magnetic Storms after a Meteor hits earth is a well-used one we know BUT this WAS really more of a family-film type entertainment and NOT in the genre of Alien or Predator.The scenery used was impressive and I think as 'Family Entertainment' there has been a lot worse."

The plot has Hong Kong cop Keung (Chan) coming to New York for his uncle's wedding and having to battle street gangs and a crime syndicate.

Though back in the 1990s, it was not my first introduction to Jackie Chan (the inferior 'Supercop' was) it was the one that got me hooked on his work. All the way through this viewing – the first in many years, the word ""silly"" kept popping up in my mind. It's dialogue, acting, stereotypes and shoddy cop work was so hilariously bad, I could only think this had to be written by someone who's only contact with the U.S.A. involves watching old 1970s cop hour-long dramas. And while some scenes were actually funny (SEE: the wrench threat) some were downright unintentionally funny (SEE: the toddler-toss and the entire closing on the golf course.) Leaving all that negative behind, it was an extreme joy watching Chan perform his own stunts in many, many inventive ways while simultaneously creating a very human and good-hearted character. The stunts were simply amazing and if one were to watch today for the first time, they need to know: he did them all himself, without a green screens, cables, etc. As arrogant as Chan is – I've read his biography, it's dripping with arrogance, he does have great gifts in originality, showmanship, pride in his work and making sure he never uses traditional American trickery/stunts. (This changes later in his work, when he was forced and got older, but this work and ones around it were all pure Chan.) Synopsis: Good-natured nephew Chan visits NYC and gets thrown in extraordinary circumstances: fighting both gangs and mob bosses while helping 2 women, his Uncle and a handicapped child. All that's irrelevant; what matters is once the action starts, it never lets up. And with an open-mind, what a fun rumble you'll have."

Russell Wong is phenomenal is a very short role.  This guy has the looks, style, and presence of Russell Crowe. Jet Li, however, is very humane and appealing, though his character is underwritten. Most of the asian characters are shortchanged dramatically. However the white (primarily Jewish) characters are shortchanged the most.  They receive the brunt of the ugly stereotyping. The kung-fu sequences are nothing special.  They are too fast and too confusing to be completely effective.  Though neat, the Xray effect detracted from the ""realism,"" sort of like the old split screen and slo-mo effects of the 1960s films. Bone-crunching is far more effective; and, would someone please dispense with this ""flying"" nonsense?  I don't want to see anything up there or the screen that is not physically possible. Special note must be made of Francoise Yip, the Female bike / fighter.  If Ms. Yip did all her own stunts, she's not only stunningly beautiful, she is also awesome. One quibble, which I feel follows a disturbing pattern in motion pictures.  Though Jet Li and Aaliyah are quite obviously in love at the close of the film, they never kiss.

Fighting and betrayal is what ""Romeo Must Die"" is all about, and the fighting is very entertaining, although sometimes a bit cheesy, because some of the ""Matrix-scenes"", which is out of place outside the world of science-fiction. Still, ""Romeo Must Die"" is an actionflick you wouldn`t want to miss.   It manages to be interesting enough, but the fighting is what makes it really good. 8/10"

Producer Joel Silver (Who also produced ""The Matrix"") describes the film as an ""Urban rendition of Romeo and Juliet"" and although this is a very simple way of looking at the film, it's not far off the mark. Like the great Shakespeare work, there are two opposing families in this film, each looking to make big commercial gains in the world of real estate development. Caught up in their lies, greed and violence are Trish O'Day (Played by Aaliyah) and Han Sing (Played by Jet Li).

2285,tt0116075,/review/rw0983203/?ref_=tt_urv,"When I first heard of this movie, I naturally just wrote it off as one of those 'formula' scary movies... you know, find one thing that a lot of people are afraid of(spiders, heights, closed rooms... and, in this case, dentists). But it was actually better than I expected. I does have some genuine scares, and the mood of the film is thoroughly creepy and unpleasant. Even though I've never been afraid to go to the dentist, I found the torture scenes to be quite painful and sometimes even hard to sit through. In fact, I might have problems the next time I go to a check-up. The plot is surprisingly original and interesting. The pacing was good... I wasn't really bored during any part of the movie. The acting is where the movie fails to surpass the low expectations towards the movie... it is exactly as bad as you'd imagine, and sometimes worse. The characters are also kind of stereotypical... there is just about every single kind of nervous girl with dental problems that you can imagine. The script also has quite a few problems... suddenly, more and more people show up to see the dentist. And even though the first couple of patients come out crying and in various states of unpleasantness, the rest of them are still (somewhat) eager to get in the chair. I did like the slow descent into madness of the dentist, Dr. Feinstone. That was surprisingly good. Normally movies like this have little to no explanation of the killers motivation, but this one had a somewhat good one. The cinematography was kind of experimental, like the camera crew and/or the director of photography wasn't sure what angles they wanted, and just threw in anything they could think of. As a result, some of it looks good, and some of it looks very first-year-of-film-school. The gore effects range from good to mediocre. I could tell how many of the effects were done, but some of them had a good... uh... effect. There was relatively little gore, which came as a surprise... most of the scares are achieved through suggestion and the eerie mood of the film. I found it to be a nice diversity when the kills were done without dental equipment... this only happens a few times through the movie, but when it does, it's a good change of pace. The film has a few good qualities, and about as many poor qualities. However, the latter group can be ignored by being a little forthcoming and looking at the good, entertaining stuff in the film. There's a good amount of attractive girls in the film, and the scares are reasonably good. I recommend this to fans of B-movies, horror flicks and possibly of the director or one or more of the actors. I urge anyone who's scared of dentists to think twice about the film, though... it might turn them entirely off to dentists. Everyone else, consider watching this movie. It's surprisingly entertaining and not as bad as many claim it is. 6/10"

You people have got to stop saying that this film ripped off Spawn.  This comic was published back in the 1980's!  The 80's folks.  Got that straight?  Now, Faust is not a good movie, it's a good looking movie. It's stylishly done.  Brian Yuzna has certainly progressed as a filmmaker. Screaming Mad George's effects are, as always, different.  There is a strange lack of gore, however (most reviews kept talking about the gore, but they obviously have not seen other Yuzna/George collaborations).  It does get a little far fetched when M turns the chick into a blob of goo.  It's just ridiculous, I wish Yuzna would take his films more seriously sometimes. I mean, sometimes it's funny, but at others it's inappropriate.  There is also a monster that looks dead-on like Dr. Freudstein in Fulci's House by the Cemetery.  My other complaint comes during the subway scene.  Why do they have to have sex after they escape danger?  It's over the top to say the least.  Faust does have a plus side.  You've got a couple of cult favorites starring.  Jeffrey Combs always adds something to a picture and Andrew Divoff is perfect as M.  He has one of the most evil voices ever (I'm just not sure about that haircut).  Mark Frost gets the award for gratuitous over-acting.  It is a comic book movie though.  There's also a great soundtrack.  Nothing like some good old fashioned heavy metal to drive a violent flick."

The psychiatrist character and actress are the most defined and well worked ones. The FX were right (wonderful make-up, specially the Van Campen-turns-into-DesireWoman one: horny at the beginning and more disturbing as it went on).

2291,tt1013860,/review/rw2604448/?ref_=tt_urv,"Maybe – most likely, even – I'm just a fatigue and endlessly grumbling horror fanatic, but personally I'm so sick and tired of allegedly cool & overly energetic comic book adaptations that put all sort of traditional horror themes together through a modern CGI-blender. The outcome of such a mix is hardly ever entertaining or originative, but more like boisterous, pretentious and derivative. For a very short while, I was actually very enthusiast to see ""Dylan Dog"", as I read that it was based on the work of the Italian comic book artist Tiziano Sclavi. This also just happens to be the inventor of ""Dellamorte Dellamore""; one of the top five greatest zombie movies ever made and still one of the most shamefully underrated horror movies in the history of cinema. But then I realized again that comic book adaptations hardly ever make good films, and in most cases they barely reflect even a glimpse of the coolness of the original comic book. Sclavi's eccentric universe offers a whole lot of potential and terrific gimmicks, like first and foremost the New Orleans setting and the rather peculiar story aspect of monsters harmoniously existing together, and director Kevin Munroe (""TMNT"") also tries hard to make his film accessible to all kinds of cinematic audiences, but the whole thing is just too damn derivative and reminiscent to other (also inferior) franchises like ""Underworld"", ""Constantine"", ""Van Helsing"", ""Watchmen"" and who knows what else. Brandon Routh, the new but unsuccessful Superman, depicts a different type of heroic character this time, as he's a supernatural detective and the human guardian of the peace-pact between the New Orleans' opposite monster clans. He's actually retired, as there haven't been any incidents for a while now, but the pact is rudely broken when a rich antique dealer is savagely killed by a lycanthrope of patriarch Gabriel's clan. The murder generates a bloody war with at stake an ancient religious relic holding the power to awaken an invincible demon named Belial. Along the process, Dylan's loyal assistant and comic relief character Marcus reluctantly transforms into a zombie and loses his limbs, and our private eye falls in love with the victim's daughter who clearly has a hidden agenda since the start. It's truly incomprehensible how a movie featuring so many versatile horror themes and monsters eventually results in such a dull and painfully clichéd wholesome. ""Dylan Dog"" doesn't feature a single highlight or memorable sequence and, on top of it all, director Munroe often reverts to rookie mistakes like the redundant narration and an overuse of comedy interludes at the expense of story coherence and/or atmosphere. The special and make-up effects, albeit plentiful, are too obviously computer engineered and hugely disrespectful towards admirers of old-fashioned horror lovers. I watched this film at the Brussels' Festival of Fantastic Films, during a midnight screening and in a theater chock-full of outrageous and hyperactive genre fanatics. The crowd's reactions were lukewarm and harsh. I guess that says enough about a film whose desperate aim is to be a crowd-pleaser"

I played some of the DOUBLE DRAGON games for Nintendo when I was younger and they were pretty jokey themselves.  This little picture has great fights, great action and most importantly of all, a great sense of humour.  Robert Patrick camps it up wonderfully as bad guy Koga Shuko.  A young Mark Dacascos (DRIVE, THE CROW: STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, CRYING FREEMAN) kicks less butt than usual but is still enjoyable.  Alyssa Milano is great as the sardonic revolutionary Marion, and both Dacascos and Scott Wolf as the Lee brothers (Dacascos is 'Home Lee' and Wolf is 'Ug Lee', geddit?) both have a fine line in sarcastic remarks.  The car chase near the start with the 'Dragon Wagon' being pursued by Abobo's van is brilliant, especially with the use of computer graphics. Again, a classic example of good, mindless fun!"

The cannibal camp exists of five hillbilly baboon-brothers, including a Jason Statham lookalike and a guy with a goofy 80s mullet, and as usual the mother is even more deranged than the boys. The carpet fitters are four dim-witted guys and one tough babe, but their chances are next to none in the ancient country mansion full of subterranean tunnels and human meat pie recipes. Luckily, I watched ""Cannibals and Carpet Fitters"" at 3am in the morning at a chock-full theater during the Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival. If it weren't for the stimulating ambiance during the annual horror-night, I probably would have been a lot less tolerant regarding the unoriginal plot and the clichéd nature & behavior of the villainous cannibal family. The bloodshed & gore is plentiful and overall satisfying (although the axe head-splitting scene at the very beginning of the film is never topped) and you gradually even develop some sympathy for the lead characters, notably for the duo Colin and Dean. This is the first full-length film of director James Bushe after a handful of interesting looking shorts.

Reb Brown stars as Major Murphy Black, leader of a group of mercenaries with very silly (nick)names (Diddy Bop, Killzone, Blood, Papa Doc, Quang) who are sent on a mission about which they have very few details, but which sees them coming face-to-visor with a high-tech renegade humanoid killer robot called Omega One."

A combined rip-off of Predator and Robocop directed by hack trash grand wizard Bruno Mattei and starring veritable Colossus of kick-ass charisma Reb Brown in the Arnie role, along with Massimo Vanni looking like Chuck Norris and the always reliable Jim Gaines, and a script by husband and wife super-scribes Claudio Fragasso (Troll 2, Zombie 4: After Death)) and Rosella Drudi. Oh and our Claudio is also the guy in the robot suit, credited under his regular pseudonym of Clyde Anderson. Anybody reading this already knows whether this film is for them or not, people generally are either Mattei fans or have sh!tty taste. But for your sake dear reader I shall go on, lest you not be quite convinced. The pacing is the only drawback here, the film takes a little while to really get into the groove so during the first third there's mostly the dialogue to go on. Fortunately the dialogue is worthy of Mamet, my favorite line being probably ""You walk like a ruptured duck"" . Clearly a film that should be shown to screen writing classes as an example of how to get this sort of thing right. The action is pretty steady when it gets going though. Things tend to alternate between people and trees being shot up real good, and trees and huts being blown up real good, with occasional people being blown up real good for varieties sake. Oh and there is a bit of knife work, but I don't know that I'd describe it as real good. It's OK though.Basically if you like films full of people walking around in the jungle and shooting at trees with occasional explosions and a robot that speaks in comically mangled digital gibberish then this is a film for you. I like all of these things, so Robowar was definitely a film for me. It even musters up occasional pockets of genuine excitement and suspense in amongst the hilarity and repetition, with a climax that is more affecting than one might expect. There's no gore other than mangled corpses and a severed limb, and no sleaze which definitely hurts things, but as far as goofy action trash aimed at the undemanding goes this is definitely a winner. Not as good as the classic Strike Commando mind you, but in Mattei rip off terms this is pretty darned decent. Way better than Shocking Dark at any rate. So watch it folks!"

One of the last films Mattei made before his death was called ""Cannibal Ferox 3: Land of Death"" and it was an extremely blatant imitation of ""Predator"" where he simply replaced the intergalactic hunter with a tribe of cannibals. When I watched that film, I didn't even know yet that ""Robowar"" existed and was thus unaware of the fact that Mattei already pulled off the exact same trick nearly twenty years earlier! This is, again, a shameless and outright rip-off of the classic 80's action flick starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, yet this time replacing the alien with an out-of-control robot that was initially designed as a  surprise, surprise  hi tech secret warfare weapon. Every other even remotely memorable element of ""Predator"" gets copied here, like the testosterone-driven lead characters, rotting human cadavers lying all around the jungle, the blurry computerized view from inside the robot's helmet, entire pieces of dialogs and even the who-played-who end credits! Needless to say this is a terribly inept and laughable B-movie exploitation product, but it is guaranteed entertainment to watch; especially in case you're an avid fan of typically Italian trash. Bunch of beefcake mercenaries, all of them with bad-boy attitudes and carrying around heavy artillery to compensate for their lack of brain capacities, are sent into to the jungle to complete a mission they know absolutely nothing about. They end up facing a practically indestructible handmade killing machine, although it suspiciously looks like a guy in a latex suit talking like he's a defect cassette with songs for children on it. The Robo-Soldier wipes out everyone before the replacement Arnie leader (Reb Brown) discovers it was constructed using spare body parts from his buddy who died in the Vietnam War. End of story. Obviously ""Robowar"" is just an insignificant and utterly brainless popcorn Sci-Fi/action/War flick with nothing else than explosives and violent shootouts. Speaking of which, I guess Bruno Mattei spent most of the nearly non-existent budget on explosives and ammunition! These dim-witted mercenaries literally fire off gazillions of bullets. Multiple sequences exist of one hireling randomly starting to shoot at trees and the others joyously join in and waste an entire arsenal. But hey, giving the quality of the acting performances, a serenade of bullets is actually less painful to listen to than the atrocious dialogs. The robot is hilariously cheesy, especially when he produces noise and recollects his past.

Ron Perlman didn't come back either, and David Harbour is a weak imitation, his Hellboy lacking singularly in charisma and feeling more like a heavy metal band member more than anything else.

The scenery is atmospheric, and the photography and editing are better than the choppy standard I have come to expect. Also the hydra itself actually looks good, not amazing, but compared to the cheap-looking and stilted-moving effects before and since this movie it is a considerable improvement. The bad news is that Hydra is still not a good movie, I have seen worse by all means but it was still lame. The main problem here was the story, a good idea on paper and is better paced than most SyFy movies but on film it was predictable and could have been developed much more than it was. The characters are the same, they are not as annoying as other SyFy efforts but still clichéd and you don't learn much about them. The hydra was not bad in look, but like the rest of the characters, you don't really feel threatened partly because the killings and gore lacked tension and had a you've-seen-it-all-before vibe and also that Hydra makes little to no attempt to expand on the hydra's origins and the like. The script is cheesy and doesn't feel like it's flowing naturally, and while they admittedly don't have much to work with the actors do nothing in their body language or their delivery to elevate the characters and script.

She informs Nolan that in order to truly defeat the hydra is to cut off the heads with a mythical sword of Hercules himself, buried in small lava pit! Got all that?! Alex McArthur is millionaire Vincent Camdon and Jana Williams is his trophy wife, Dixie. They orchestrate and prepare the hunt for their clientèle. The CGI for the film is as dreadful as you'd expect as the hydra chomps down on human heads and it looks unrealistic and laughable.

Like Wyvern, the story and dialog is more involved, better detailed, and runs much more fluid than your typical Sci Fi Channel fare. The long shots and scenic vistas are new for Sci Fi Channel releases, and I have to say they add a great deal to the overall feel and effect of the work. But moreover, the CGI has been amped up a bit and looks like something in which you can suspend belief, for a change. That has been the greatest problem with Sci Fi Original movies, thus far...the horrible CG, trite dialog, and terrible acting ruin the possibility of enjoying a good suspension of belief, thereby negating its own work.

And let's not get started on the alien weapons, I do agree that they look like children's toys. The story is not involving at all, that it's so predictable that you can smell the ending a mile away is one thing but there's also very little fun, suspenseful or thrilling on display, there are moments but they are too far and between. The dialogue is painfully under-written and trite, the direction is completely flat and the characters are little more than ciphers that don't do much of a good job moving the story forward.

However the change to torture horror (I'm not a fan of it) and escape from that genre/threat horror was a jarring thematic shift that really did not need to be done and added little to the film because one of the killers was revealed minutes earlier. It just made the film wacky D class and shoddy as the mix of used technologies, motives, and introduced questions just added uninteresting weigh to a movie near it's end. I'm so sure people thought this would be interesting different and make the film unique and it did confuse me but it made a hardly tolerable film (it got more difficult to watch as it because more unbelievable) just nonsensical. In short, the pre-ending was all over the place and really detracted from the film. And I'm not convinced that some and not all humans were threatening to the creatures as they seemed to target two groups who came to visit. I'd figure any human could attach more and thus any human was a threat so the residents would have gotten the business also. And the full monster reveal at the end was just a pitiful case of bad effects, better to have left a reveal of a hand or fist with such a poor looking creature.

The premise is quite creative, the film pays homage to legendary titles and directors and  believe it or not  there even is tension to detect in the script. Jill Schoelen (The Stepfather, Phantom of the Opera) is the ambitious student Maggie who wants to turn her always-returning nightmares into a screenplay. When she's preparing a horror marathon event with some fellow students, she stumbles upon footage that proves her nightmares are real and that she might even be a completely different person. During the movie shows at the remote theater, an actual murderer shows up and goes after Maggie. Granted, Popcorn is an 80's slasher in disguise but at least it tries to be ingenious on several levels. The invented titles that are shown during the ""horrorthon"" also have potential if you ask me! Who wouldn't pay money to see flicks called ""The Amazing Electrified Man"","" Mosquito"" or ""The Stench""? I sure would As said before, some sequences are quite suspenseful (like the eerie ""possessor"" film) and the murders aren't too gross. I had some prejudices as well before watching it but I'm glad to admit I was wrong. Too bad the last twenty minutes (and the climax in particular) are a bit of a letdown. Logic wasn't Popcorn biggest trump to begin with but, near the end, director Mark Harrier completely loses his grip on the messy screenplay. Also, the humor most of the time is painfully unfunny (for example on of the male leads constantly bumps his head or falls down) and irritating. Best aspects truly are the light-headed atmosphere, creative plot-twists and very good costumes and scenery.

It's also a twist and tease of drama, suspense, fun comedy, and murder in a bloody slasher type of a way. Set in California at a college some film students decide to run an night horror marathon at an old run down cinema house. The students will do crazy special effects while the crowd watches the old vintage 50's and 60's films. Thru it during the night a crazy sadistic killer is on the loose causing an 80's slasher type stalker feel, from behind the curtain and thru the audience. As this creep has a connection to an old film called ""The Possessor"" plus this monster knows one of the film students from his past. Also horror queen legend Dee Wallace Stone has a part that's memorable as a damsel in distress who's kidnapped and has her mouth taped with white duct tape!

A story about something that is not named merging with Jean Grey, aliens that are not named coming to take control over it - by using sheer number and physical strength, obviously, a government that goes from hailing the X-Men to mutant detention facilities in a day and characters that switch from love to murderous hate in seconds. Nothing makes any sense! The film connects to none of the previous films, has actors in it just for the sake of killing them off or doesn't have them at all, in some cases. It's just a standalone X-men-like film that just doesn't seem to be part of the same thing.

2428,tt0119642,/review/rw2552947/?ref_=tt_urv,"I can agree with other sentiments here: ""Mean Guns"" is more than just the standard B movie. I was lured to this thing by the names involved, but what we get here is not relentlessly predictable stuff. A crime boss named Vincent Moon (Ice-T) gathers a large group of lowlifes together, people who've ""betrayed"" their organization basically by being screw-ups. Moon's idea is to put all of them into a ""kill or be killed"" situation, providing them with various weapons, and the last three standing will supposedly walk away with the sum of $10 million. In addition to The T, we get other B movie perennials doing their thing; Christopher Lambert brings his own brand of acting to a more jovial - and unhinged - character than usual. Also appearing are Deborah Van Valkenburgh (""The Warriors""), Thom Mathews (""The Return of the Living Dead""), Yuji Okumoto (""The Karate Kid, Part II""), Tina Cote (""Omega Doom""), Kimberly Warren (""Blast""), and Michael Halsey (""Dollman""). Hoke Howell of such classics as ""Kingdom of the Spiders"" and ""Humanoids from the Deep"" has a cameo at the outset. As one will notice, the cast is largely made up of regulars in the films of the prolific Albert Pyun, and it don't matter if the acting ain't ever gonna win any awards; it still gets the job done. The T is amusing in the lead, and Lambert is actually a hoot, although it's veteran Halsey that really stands out, playing one of the most interesting characters in the whole thing. Van Valkenburgh is likable enough as the most sympathetic of them all. Mathews and Okumoto have their moments as a consistently bantering pair of buddies. It's hard to knock a movie that immediately goes for the approach of underscoring the fast and furious action with mambo music, which adds to the humour. Of course, when one sees the ridiculous fate of one of the characters, they'll see this is never meant to be taken too seriously. At an hour and 50 minutes it IS awfully long for this sort of thing, but that kooky charm still pervades the proceedings. And, despite all the violence, there's really no gore at all. Fans of low budget escapist fare should find this reasonably interesting and diverting, all the way to its unexpected ending. Seven out of 10."

Moreover, Pyun has written 14 of his own feature films, many of those mentioned above as well as ""Radioactive Dreams"" (1986), ""Heatseeker"" (1995), and ""Nemesis 2"" (1995). Pyun's action-adventure sagas belong to either the science fiction or martial arts genres. Typically, Pyun's virile heroes find themselves entangled in suicidal situations against villains who appear in greater numbers or who have special mutant features that give them a deadly edge.

2434,tt0185371,/review/rw0625260/?ref_=tt_urv,"Asylums.  Crazy people.  Insanity.  Mental therapy, mental hospitals, mental patients have been used time and time again in horror fiction and horror films.  Why?  I'm not sure;  maybe, it is the normality of being like those that are insane which brings a more genuine horror  to us.  Whatever it is, House on Haunted Hill certainly uses all the mental derangement cliches to full effect.  I could easily pan this film by saying(and rightly so) that its predecessor, the original House on Haunted Hill directed by William Castle, is a far superior film.  That Castle's film was filled with better acting, better timing, and easily a better script.  But I liked this film, which is not really a remake entirely.  It has many elements that are not in the first film;  most of them centering around the mental aspect aforementioned.  The house in this film was once an asylum where people...thousands perhaps..were brutally butchered in the name of mental good health.  The house is scary.  Empty corridors, large, vast rooms, incredible special effects all add to the frightening aspects of the film. The biggest problem with the film is that much of it just doesn't add up in terms of making sense of the plot.  The film fortunately is more special effects driven than plot driven, and at least is able to deliver the goods in that arena.  The acting is pretty good with all the leads really doing quite a good job.  Geoffrey Rush gives his best Vincent Price impression(pencil-thin mustache and all) delivering lines with bravura gusto.  The other exceptional standout is Chris Kattan as Watson Pritchard. Kattan is just wonderful in the role showcasing his obvious talent.  As far as great horror films go...this film is adequate, yet very thrilling, exciting, and entertaining.  If you are like me and love the old one...just look at this film as a totally different entity.  It is.  One thing is for sure...it is one heck of a rollercoaster ride!"
2435,tt0185371,/review/rw2901888/?ref_=tt_urv,"Some of this reviewers need to take a chill pill. There is a huge difference between a remake (which statistically Hollywood tends to mess up more often than it succeeds) and a re-imagining, where the Rulebook is thrown out the window and, basically, its No Holds Barred. This is a re-imagining and as such it is really a lot of fun. It is one thing to make the jump from B&W to colour. It is an entirely different order of magnitude to pump up your re-do with hi tech special effects, magic glasses that enable the characters to see what should not be seen, and at the finale, some sort of giant clockwork that you would otherwise expect to find in Dr. Who. This film was released at Halloween, which means in effect that the studio was looking for a fast buck and not trying to produce THE MATRIX. I think they exceeded their own expectations. A great cast, recognizable names, and the wandering through the basement is very creepy and good scary fun."

For some reason it's panned over other far worse ones he's churned out of the gumball machine (ever re-watch Billy Madison? What the hell were we/they thinking back then?), but when you part the curtains of Sandler Stigma and really just look at what the movie is in itself, it's a hoot. What other film can boast Rodney Dangerfield playing Harvey Keitel's dad in heell? That's right, Keitel is the red beast himself, coming down off a ten thousand year unholy monarchy, with no plans to retire. This infuriates his two wicked sons, played by Tiny Lister (must have been a different devil-mom) and a slick Rhys Ifans. They depart the inferno and set up their own devilish franchise up in New York City, raising all kinds of hell, the most amusing of which is lowering the drinking age to ten (where were these guys when I was that age?) and forcing Regis Philbin to say naughty things on live primetime. Their younger, slightly retarded brother Nicky (Sandler) must pursue them on their haunts and trap them in a magic flask before it's too late. Dumb concept, right? Sure it is, but try and tell me it's not hilarious m, especially with the amount of inane visual gags and trippy production design these folks have dreamed up. Between Hitler dressed as a slutty maid getting a pineapple repeatedly rammed up his rectum to a giant gorilla massaging mammaries that have sprouted on a dude's head like fleshy succulent pigtails, there's no shortage of wtf moments. Sander picks an odd character mask as usual, sporting a metal-head swoosh of a haircut and lisping his way through his lines sounding like he had a stroke from watching Billy Madison dailies one too many times. Patricia Arquette is in it, as a sweet, shy girl he meets topside and the closest thing to a sane person you'll find in this madhouse. Cameos abound, from usual Sandler cronies like Jon Lovitz, Rob Schneider, Kevin Nealon, Dana Carvey, Peter Dante and Allen Covert, to randoms like Michael McKean, Clint Howard, Laura Harring, Henry Winkler, Ozzy Osborne, Reese Witherspoon as Nicky's angelic mom and Quentin Tarantino as a blind preacher. I don't really know what else to say about the thing, because its it's own thing and you either rock out with it, or you don't. Visually it's never boring, the script was conceived in the toilet and jumped straight to the gutter, the performances are all garishly obnoxious and the overall tone is that of an sixth grade birthday party gone rogue."

However, Formula One wouldn't allow the access that it did for Grand Prix in 1966, so the director defaulted to the North American CART series.  CART allowed unprecedented access to its venues, races, paddock, announcers, drivers, sponsors, etc.  But this movie fails in that it is nothing more than an auto racing cliché.  As a fan, it's hard to rebuff the blood sport aspect of the sport to those who are not fans.  The crashes are incredibly unrealistic, some of the tracks are non-existent and the drivers are paper thin.  The scene near the swimming pool with the blonde vixen doing some sort of goofy water aerobics is pathetic.  The part where Jimmy Bly steals a car (that happens to be filled with fuel indoors and doesn't need an external starter to run) and drives it through the Chicago streets with Stalone in tow is just ridiculous.  And to they get arrested or even prosecuted for this action?  No, they just are forced to convey one of the stupidest dialogues in the history of racing movies."

I heard many people on the Internet praise the hell out of Scott for delivering the best performance of his life in the role of Cain Burgess an escaped convict on the way to return all the disgusting stuff his life throws at him and they were right because I hope he keeps testing his acting range like this because Avengement is one hard-ass movie with some of the bloodiest action scene I saw from Scott since Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning.

2456,tt1183276,/review/rw2751392/?ref_=tt_urv,"The French film ""La Horde"" doesn't exactly bring a fresh approach to the over saturated zombie genre, yet is still entertaining enough for what it is. It benefits from its breakneck pace and intensity, and is just as much about character as it is bloodshed. (Not that it skimps in the gore department at all, though, far from it.) A quartet of detectives - Aurore (Claude Perron), Ouessem (Jean-Pierre Martins), Jimenez (Aurelien Recoing), and Tony (Antoine Oppenheim), find the dead body of a colleague and turn rogue, vowing to avenge his death. Unfortunately, things don't go as planned: first, their quarry, gangster Adewale (Eriq Ebouaney), is able to get the drop on them, and start torturing them, then this big mess becomes an even bigger one when scores upon scores of the living dead start to overwhelm humanity, as the apocalypse seems to have begun. While this is all pretty predictable in terms of the script, ""La Horde"" does manage to entertain by ensuring that its audience never gets bored. It starts quietly enough, but soon it's kicked itself into a high gear and has stayed there. Some zombie cinema lovers may take exception to the fact that these are very FAST zombies, as well as to the generous array of digital rather than practical carnage, but if you don't concern yourself too much with those elements, you may find this a reasonable viewing experience. The characters, by and large, are NOT sympathetic, including the cops, so the lack of rooting interest may make this hard for some people to follow. Still, as in any film with a similar premise, there is a certain amusement in seeing cops and crooks alike being forced to team up in order to survive - and, as we can see, the crooks aren't completely one- dimensional. The acting is good for this sort of thing. Both Martins and Ebouaney have a formidable screen presence, and Martins has one hell of a great exit where he truly goes down fighting. While ""La Horde"" may not be among the most stimulating films of its kind - at least in an intellectual way - one could definitely do far worse, as it manages to maintain a fever pitch for much of its duration.

While Belly Of The Beast had some enjoyment laughing at the over the top action this film is so painfully bad that it is almost upsetting. Now I have never been the biggest Seagal fan. Having said that I have enjoyed watching his earlier films. They were pure dumb and ultra violent films with an enjoyably pretentious moralistic attitude. Seagal had that kind of Italian American, Brooklyn tough guy thing going on, his kind of De Niro and Brando impersonation. Since Under Siege though, he has become the eco-Zen- Warrior with absolutely no personality. He was in decent shape as well, never the ripped muscle man like Arnie, Sly and Van Damme but a real man kind of size and he was very quick. The action scenes in those films were brutal and slick and we would see in full glory the aikido from Seagal. Nowadays Seagal, after one two many pies, is looking very withered and old and overweight. In modern Seagal fights the are film extremely tightly with the odd wide shot featuring his stunt double and is edited in such a way to hide the fact that he is just not quick enough anymore. Seagal looks tragically bloated and sweaty and almost repugnant. I cannot see how even the most ardent Seagal fan could be anything but devastated seeing him do films like this and looking the way he does. Somehow he still sells a movie but at this rate it won't be for long."

When she is sold into slavery, Seagal has to travel to Poland where, of course, he gets to hang out with a babe, shoot it out with a bunch of heavies, and do some hokey martial arts stuff as well as try to act and conceal his big, fat gut. A sorry attempt at film making, ""Out of Reach"" has too many deficits to list here.

Michelle Pfieffer, the perfect choice for Catwoman and was perfectly cast into place. As much as I love and is such an incredible actress Annette Benning, she couldn't have been Catwoman, she doesn't really have the look. Danny DeVito, who could have imagined him as The Penguin?

Michael Keaten is suitably brooding as the Dark Knight, better than George Clooney in Batman and Robin (considered as the worst out the franchise)though he is overshadowed by the villains, namely Danny DeVito as the Penguin, who looked as though he was having a ball, and brought a sense of sadness and grotesquesness to the role. Christopher Walken was effective also as Max Schrek. Stealing the show, with her flawless delivery of not-so special lines, is Michelle Pfeiffer as the sexy and manipulative Catwoman. The film looks lovely, with the sets and effects, and Tim Burton directs with detail. However the film does drag, and while there are some intelligent lines from the villains, the script could have been developed a little more. All in all, a dark and entertaining film. Whereas Batman Forever is funnier and more fast paced, Batman Returns is darker, but just lacks the sophistication of the first film. 8/10 Bethany Cox."

As such I give these efforts a lot of slack. I mean, come on, it has to be hard to be a Russian special effects technician. Not a lot of big budget films getting made there. BUT-- they are a dedicated bunch and more than willing to throw their all into whatever lame American monster flick needs affordable SFX. And I get a kick out of looking for the same locations appear time and again in these flicks. If for some reason you find yourself watching this again, look at the sequence where Pare and company are walking through a ""jungle."" Look at their feet and you'll see paved walkways. And if you happen to still have a copy of ""AI Assault"" (shown a week or two earlier also on SciFi), you'll see the folks in there tramping through the same ersatz jungle.

And he adds a Cobra. Most of the movie is spent listening to the self-righteous characters prattle on about the evil capitalist pigs, while sandwiched between this cavalcade of condescension are flashbacks to what happened on the island before they got there. DNA experiments were conducted, critters started to grow, people spoke to each other without coming off as being morally superior jerks, etc. Needless to say, it would have been a much better movie if they would have made the flashbacks the movie and forgotten about the sanctimonious do-gooders. Lest I forget, there are a few short scenes scattered here and there where the holier-than-thou posse gets picked off one by one, but they probably comprise less than 2% of the film. The main event pitting our title characters against each other lasts about one minute and is as exciting as watching the previews for the latest Dino-Crisis video game."

This is a guy who's made a habit of ruthlessly eviscerating everyone he's ever encountered, yet now he passes harmlessly through a loaded subway car and cheerfully lifts his mask to scare a gang of punks like a haunted house denizen.

Predating the spate of early 80's knife-kill flicks meant that 'Horror' as a genre still meant supernatural thriller when this picture was made, and it relies heavily on a taut atmosphere of suspicion and fear among the passengers for its shocks.  There are few of the Hallowe'en style jolts that we associate with contemporary horror, in fact very little happens.  Watching it again just a few years ago I was surprised that it still gave me chills from its tight, claustrophobic shooting and editing style in a way that good giallo thrillers do (and most giallo pictures, rather disappointingly do not). The writing and acting are standard made for TV disaster fare and the picture is less impressive if you focus on that.

If Cannonball loses Benny will enter into a world of pain, so Benny tries any and every trick he can think of to ensure Cannonball's competitors lose. Cannonball's main competition is the borderline psychotic Redman ('Deliverance's Bill McKinney), but the race also includes Cannonball's sidekick Zippo (Archie Hahn), his parole officer girlfriend (Veronica Hammel), a bus full of babes led by frequent Bartel co-star Mary Woronov, an aspiring country singer (Gerrit Graham), and surfer types Robert Carradine and Belinda Balaski. 1970s exploitation fans will recognize these actors, and several others that make appearances throughout this stupid but fun movie, and buffs will also spot various film makers in cameos including Roger Corman, Martin Scorsese and Joe Dante.

Unlike ""Squirm,"" a straightforward tale of backwoods terror, ""Blue Sunshine"" is more of a thinking-man's picture, featuring a protagonist in Zalman King who always seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, behaving in the most guilty manner possible! It's certainly a challenge to warm up to a character described on screen as 'erratic,' but there are other compensations and mysteries that come together nicely for the fadeout. The title refers to a type of LSD available at Stanford circa 1967, and anyone known to have sampled it becoming irritable and homicidal after a decade's passing, preceded by their hair falling out. Among the cast, Robert Walden is a standout, funny even in a serious surgeon part, and Mark Goddard, enjoying a juicy screen role as a Senatorial candidate who knows more than he lets on.

2512,tt0063240,/review/rw1736795/?ref_=tt_urv,"You know what a typical Hammer production looks like, and ""The Lost Continent"" definitely doesn't fit that picture. It doesn't feature any old Gothic castles or torture dungeons, any cloaked vampires or mad Barons and it doesn't even star Christopher Lee or Peter Cushing. Surely Hammer also produced other mythologist films and stories revolving on time warps, but ""The Lost Continent"" is an entire league on its own and the complete opposite to what you expect. Right after watching this movie, you can't even properly determine for yourself whether it's good or bad  just plain weird. ""The Lost Continent"" is an outrageously plotted but awkwardly coherent film with two entirely different main story lines rolled into one. The titular continent (although it's merely just a small island) actually doesn't get reached until the twenty last minutes and, before that, it is just a suspenseful thriller set on a boat. The ambiance on the ancient and leaky cargo ship is rather tense and sinister. The captain ignores safety warnings and advice from his personnel and the passengers prefer facing a terrible sea storm rather than to return to the coast, even though they have been informed about the potentially explosive cargo. Suffice to say these aren't normal tourists, but people with dark secrets or even fugitive criminals. There are a lot of intrigues going on-board, but the sea is mightier. The captain and his passengers have to abandon ship, but they recover another one slowly drift towards uncharted regions. There they encounter ravenous seaweed and a lot of other things that don't make the least bit of sense, like gigantic crab-creatures, a native tribe under the impression that the Spanish Inquisition isn't finished yet and a local girl with the most gorgeous pair of breasts in the universe. In order to set food on land, they have to put watery pillows on their feet and attach balloons on their shoulders, which forms another very ludicrous sight to behold. ""The Lost Continent"" is an incredibly silly film, but all cast members perform their roles with a poker straight face, like as if they were starring in the greatest & most budgeted epic adventure in the history of cinema. The effects and monsters designs are extremely dodgy and laughable, but also somewhat charming. The film hasn't got a real ending, but (fortunately?) Hammer never bothered to make a sequel. Crazy little Brit-film, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to open-minded fans of cult cinema."

In a scene that's still present, Neff agreed to give Carruthers sexual favours if he'll let her keep the securities she's stolen from the dictator.

Strangler of the Swamp is a neat little cheapie, though, and it's atmosphere is unlike that of any other Hollywood film, with the exception of Night of the Hunter. Perhaps Charles Laughton caught this at the bottom of the bill one night and tucked his memories away for a decade. It certainly strikes me as being more or a fable than a true horror story, and what little I've read of Frank Wisbar's earlier Ferryboat Maria seems to bear out that interpretation. The film is rife with illogic, starting with the idea that a ferry is needed across a swamp that seems to span no more than a few yards. Villagers try to run  away in order to escape the curse of the Strangler, and instead of leaving via the ferry they take a donkey cart on a road that otherwise doesn't figure into the story! Leading lady Rosemary La Planche sleepwalks through her role as the granddaughter of the cursed ferryman, and Blake Edwards is reasonably likeable as the heartthrob whose love heals all wounds. All things considered--not least it's brevity and dreamlike atmosphere--Strangler of the Swamp is essential viewing for anyone interested in second features, Poverty Row cinema, or the influence of German filmmakers on American cinema."

It is a pretty neat little film with some good horror sequences of zombies in graveyards and zombies administering revenge.  The revenge is based on a woman who loses her boyfriend to thugs wanting to buy his business.  He is beat to death and Marki Bey(who by the way is VERY easy to look at)seeks the help of an old voodoo woman(played by the woman that played Mrs. Jefferson on the Jeffersons)that helps her reach the spirit world. She sells her soul for the help of the zombies.  The next part of the film deals with the revenge sequences for each individual in the mafia-like gang.  The murders are chilling, well-executed(no pun intended), and have a pinch of humour as well.  The acting is decent for this kind of film. Vampire star Robert Quarry, having to fill a contract obligation, plays the heavy with his usual charm and wit.  The scenery and sets are very good too, but remember this is the 70's...the music is something and the clothes are like WoW!  All in all a good zombie flick."

As you can derive already from this two-line synopsis intro, ""Sugar Hill"" is a Blaxsploitation horror effort, like the contemporary blockbusters ""Blackenstein"" and ""Blacula"", only with voodoo spells and zombies this time. The owner of Club Haiti gets killed for not giving in to the mafia's blackmail, but his left behind wife Sugar, nicknamed like this because she is – and I quote – looks as sweet as sugar tastes, plots a virulent revenge.

The story naturally concentrates on capturing this creature before it destroys Italy.  Like other monster films where the monsters are the sympathetic ones and the real monsters are the people, 20 Million Miles to Earth depicts a creature that is inquiring, basically harmless unless provoked, and heroic despite its eventual fate. Ray Harryhausen did a terrific job with his stop-motion animation, especially when we see the beast battle an elephant in the streets of Rome. The acting is decent, not as bad as some critics would argue.  The film is pure entertainment and yet another commentary on mankind and the whole concept of the stranger within our society."

2528,tt0088392,/review/rw1986378/?ref_=tt_urv,"Well this has been hiding under the surface, as it took a friend to mention about it for me pay notice. The copy I just watched happened to be there's too. 'What Waits Below' is a minor, but completely distinctive and enjoyable horror/adventure trek in some underground caverns. Neil Marshall's 2005 feature 'The Descent' might shoot to mind, but other than featuring albinos' (known as Lemurians') living the caves, the tone is much different. The adventure aspect easily beats out the horror elements that are looming. I found it to lose its way in the last 20 minutes, as the story shows up its lack of ideas and the script's thin base. Still after a slow beginning it keeps you watching and manages some effective shocks, interesting atmospherics and sprinkles of moody suspense with Denny Jaeger and Michel Rubini's edgily wounding score perfectly streamlining (if at times overshadowing) the presentation. Eerie locations and pastel set-designs within the cave system make it like you've entered another world and the make-up/costumes for the Lemurians' are quite standard. Director Don Sharp's tight and compact handling doesn't let its budget restraints entirely bog it down and the performances are mostly good. Robert Powell is an undervalued actor and makes light work of his performance by presenting an easy-going charm and class. Timothy Bottoms is efficient and the gorgeously fixating Lisa Blount gives a hardy turn. Modest low-budget horror/adventure item that goes on to promise more than it actually delivers."
2529,tt0088392,/review/rw2515212/?ref_=tt_urv,"I had to principal reasons to check out the relatively obscure 80's cave-horror movie. First of all because I read in several reviews that the film can be considered as an antecedent of Neil Marshall's acclaimed 2005 hit ""The Descent"", in which a bunch of extreme sport chicks encounter a strange breed of predators in a previously unexplored cave. The second reason is because this was the last meaningful film of Don Sharp. This underrated Australian-born director made a few very cool movies for Hammer studios, like ""Kiss of the Vampire"" and ""Rasputin: The Mad Monk"", as well as a few other sadly overlooked genre gems like ""Dark Places"" and ""Psychomania"" (about a gang of zombie bikers!). ""What Waits Below"" has a peculiar but potentially interesting premise, and dark ominous caves have always been effective settings for horror flicks. Whenever a group of teenagers, scientists or speleologists plummets down a cavern, there's always some type of monster or estranged civilization to knock them off. The problem here, however, is that takes an enormous long time before something happens and when the menace does eventually gets personified, you'll only feel underwhelmed and maybe even tempted to chuckle. Robert Powell, who starred in some bizarre horror films before like ""The Survivor"" and ""Harlequin"", plays a caving expert hired by the army to install a radio transmitter inside a Central American cave. I think it was to remain in contact with submarines, or something I didn't quite understand that part. Anyway, not important, because the radio as well as the soldiers on guard mysteriously vanish during the first night and Powell leads an expedition deeper down into the cavern. Plentiful of dull conversations and false scares later, the group stumbles upon a whole community of albino dorks. The cave people seriously don't look the least bit scary. Earlier in the film, there' a confusing sequence with some sort of snake monster that peeps out of a hole in the stone wall and kills off one of the soldiers. Even though that creature is a lot more horrific – albeit also a bit cheesy and typically 80's – it would have been a better idea to revolve the film on. Don Sharp generates a bit of morbid atmosphere in the beginning of the descent, but it quickly becomes tedious and too enticing to fast forward. Still, good performances by Lisa Blount and Timothy Bottoms as the despicable army superior."

Video stores were still mostly independently owned in those days and were sweeping the country, so the writers here took the old ""aliens invade earth"" scenario and use the VCR growth as a means in which the aliens can infiltrate and infect the human population. How so? Well, whoever watches the video will become hypnotized/entranced/controlled by the secret message, and will turn into a crazed murderous freak!

All this is unbeknownst to entertainment lawyer Ken Griffiths (Wings) and his wife Cheri (Beck), who are traveling through the town in their RV. They stop to pick up the loner Reilly (Hopkins) and when they see the chaos in Canyonland, they decide to fight back. Aiding them is Sheriff Hanks (Kennedy).

However, we weren't totally convinced that it was being used to its full potential. Wings' personality should have shone through more, Kennedy is barely involved, and there isn't a lot of meat to Hopkins' laconic tough-guy. Neal Wheeler as Charley, the first victim, is reminiscent of the notorious cover for the Super Nintendo game ""Phalanx"".

2587,tt1179891,/review/rw3639640/?ref_=tt_urv,"Much like in the original 1981 Canadian slasher film of the same name; this 2009 American 3D remake centered, around murders committed, near Valentine's Day, perpetuated by a psychopath in a miner's outfit. However, while this movie directed by Patrick Lussier seem like it was trying its own ideas, much the outline was just recycle sequences from the first movie. After all, the movie starts out the same with the methane gas explosion, but instead of having the psychopath blame the supervisors for abandoning them in the mine for a Valentine Day party; in the remake, they choose to have the miner go after the owner's son, Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles) for forgetting to vent the methane lines. Though a deleted scene does reveal, the killer was trapped while a Valentine's Day dance was being held. Still, because of this change, the focus on the gimmick of the killer sending real-life bloody hearts to his victims seems a bit, out of the blue. Why? Because, when I now, think about it, this remake barely has anything to do with Valentine Day, besides the triangle love story between Tom's best friend Axel Palmer (Kerr Smith), Axel's wife/ Tom's ex-girlfriend, Sarah (Jamie King) and himself. For the most part, the killer just killed random people that has nothing with the main plot, such as the pointless murderous rampage at the motel in the middle or the hospital in the beginning. Another problem with this movie is the awkward structure, it has. Its starts off in 1997, with too quick, over exposition newspaper clipping of the killer being trapped, that does give enough information to explain, why the miner acts the way, he does. Then, the film cut to a year later, with the killer, somehow waking up from his coma in the hospital, and having the strength to goes on a murderous rampage at a miner party that shouldn't had been there, and then, finally ten years later in 2008, when the ageless, Tom returns to reclaim his father's mine and confronting his friends who abandoned him in the mine with the killer. It's all over the place. Without spoiling the movie, too much, the movie is full of plot-holes, such as the grocery store scene and how the sheriff know about the killer being in the house, even the plot twist toward the end, doesn't make a lick of sense, when you think about it. After all, what ever happen to the miner's body in the end!? Another problem with this movie is the choice of acting. Everybody was dry and too serious. There was hardly any wit or charm. It's sad, because one of the actors, is normally enjoyable. After all, he come from a TV Show 'Supernatural' that had an episode (Season 5, 14th episode) that had the same title of this movie, and a similar plot. So, it was possible to make this movie, fun to watch. Instead, everybody felt mostly uniformly unsavory, obnoxious and unsympathetic. Because of this, I really wouldn't care, about their relationship or the character's well-beings. It really took me, out of the movie. Another thing that sicken me, was the overused of the 3D. There was so many images, being thrown in your face that it becomes deadening overkill. It gave me, a headache like the flashing news opening. Clearly, somebody was trying to rip-off, the Daily Prophet. It really doesn't fit in this type of a world. If that wasn't bad, enough. The CGI gore effects were also really bad. It's sad, because the original had some of the best visual effects, at the time. I really couldn't get behind the film, due to how cheap and fake, it look. Another thing that was jarring, was the overused of full-frontal nudity that for the most part, wasn't needed. It was very gimmicky. It must had been very uncomfortable for actress Betsy Rue as the character, Irene to bare it all. It really felt that she got exploited by writers, Todd Farmer and Zane Smith. Even the studio and producers felt that the gore and nudity might had gone too far, as they cut the film from 101 min to 94 mins for some countries like Australia. Then, there was the fact that the movie was going to be released on Friday, February 13, 2009. However, release date was pushed up three weekends to January 23, 2009 so that this film would not have to compete with Friday the 13th remake, a film with a much bigger name. Overall: while the movie was still a success at the box office. I really don't get, why some people like this movie, over the original, because it's bad. For me, it's not worth digging for.

""Hitch Hike"" can be called a precursor to the action films that litter multiplexes now, but it is also much more.  It's an uncommon little B movie with the gloss and name actors (Franco Nero, Corrine Clery) of an A picture, along with a surprising moral slant, gay stickup men, and twists galore.  Like most Italian exploitation films, ""Hitch Hike"" sometimes bogs down in a bit too much excess talk, but it helps flesh out the characters--they're not mere victims or heroes, but people, too.  And for fans of Hess, this is a no-brainer.  (A word of advice--seek out the Anchor Bay DVD, which is remastered and preserves the film's 1.85:1 aspect ratio.)"

But for me, I could watch it on it's own terms and I enyojed what this movie had to give by making Chucky AI that actually does want to be Andy's friend but it is deeply broken on the inside. It's able to explore some very different things like friendship, jealousy and it takes things in a very different direction. For me it's not as good as the original, but I can still have a lot of fun with it."

2608,tt1714203,/review/rw2620320/?ref_=tt_urv,"Well this was a huge disappointment! I really liked the first Piranha 3D film so I was looking forward to this. This is a lazy, lifeless, and pointless sequel that had no business being made. Instead of being so bad it's good like the first film, this one is just so bad it's terrible. For starters, the first Piranha film actually had likable characters and somewhat of a plot to it. This one has the thinest of a plot you can get and the characters are incredibly lifeless and not even the main character serves any purpose to the film at all. You'd think that with this being a sequel they would amp up the gore and deaths, but the deaths in this one are actually tamer than the first and there's actually less of them. The film tries to be much more of a comedy this time around by adding more humor which all of it falls flat. The humor in this film is so awful and outdated thats it's hard to believe anyone over the age of 13 actually wrote this film. But, what really annoyed me about this film is just how damn stupid it is! The writers couldn't even come up with a decent way to get these characters in a situation to set up a death scene and instead have them do something really stupid or come up with a really stupid reason to get them in a situation that sets up a lame death. The acting here (even though it's suppose to be bad) is bad even for a B-Movie. And just when you think you will finally get a payoff after sitting through 55 minutes of crap, the film presents you with a lazy and totally underwhelming climax that is filmed so poorly that most of the time you can't even tell what is going on (And this really sucks because that was the highlight of the first film). And then, the film presents us with an ending so stupid and forced that even those who can suspend their disbelief the most will be left frustrated with just how incredibly stupid the ending is. The film is a short (althought it feels much longer) 70 minutes followed by 11 minutes of credits that include a ton of lame outtakes. I can now see why The Weinstein Company decided to only release this in barely any theaters and just put in on VOD. I still can't believe how bad this movie was. The director John Gulager shouldn't ever be allowed to be involved with a film ever again because this guy can't direct to save his life. Alexandre Aja who directed the first film actually understood the material he was working with. John Gulager had no idea what the hell he was doing and just decided the wip out a POS to make a quick buck because he obviously didn't care about this film at all and just wanted to get paid. As far as the cameo's in the film go, Gary Busey is only in the films opening scene and is wasted (the only thing we get to see him do is light a cow's farts on fire). Ving Rhames cameo doesn't just feel forced, but also is just really pathetic and sad to watch. The only positive things I can say about this film was that David Hasselfhoff's scenes are actually chuckle worthy and there's a lot of gorgeous nude women on screen many times. Even though i'm only giving the film 1/2 a star, that feels generous. This film could've really been a blast and fun just like the first one was, but it really is just an atrocity of a film that not even the biggest fans of the first one will enjoy. If you are looking for a fun B-Movie, go rent Piranha 3D and just forget that this film even exist. Piranha 3DD tries to so self-award of itself that it just ends up being exactly what it's parodying."

Now, the status of the movie inside said case could be questionable, but how can you pass up that art? Luckily The Outing is not that bad. Granted, the acting could use some touching up and the formula is an old one, but the gore effects stand out and the sheer eighties-ness of the piece shines through. The Outing (aka The Lamp) is about a group of high school students who decide to spend the night at the local museum. Unbeknownst to them the newest piece at the museum is a genie lamp harboring an evil Djinn. Keep in mind that this was many years before Wishmaster was made. When the horny teens decide to split up and explore the place (and each other) the Djinn is set loose to work his evil magic. That's the formulaic part. But there are some interesting moments along the way. Highlights include: A man getting ripped in half under water, a scientist being thrown into a ceiling fan, and a nubile teen taking a bath with snakes.

When the same girl and her friends decide to spend the night in the museum for a little carnal fun he pops up and starts killing everyone in various exotic ways.  Watch for a boy snapped in half at the waist and dead snakes brought back to life to deliver poisonous bites.

The characters weren't great and weren't bad either.  Sure, we've seen it all before in other films but I have little hope of finding a film that's completely original.  Frankly, I got about what I expected out of it - motion picture fastfood.  You enjoy it as you take it in and digest it and forget about it after you leave the theater.  It's just entertainment and not bad for what it is.  Unlike LOST IN SPACE or BATMAN AND ROBIN, this film isn't boring.  It moves at a quick enough pace to where you don't find yourself checking your watch all the time.  I'm not sure what the deal was with Donald Sutherland's character who displays no sense of logic whatsoever.  Had they dropped the stuff with his character, it would've helped the film.

So maybe this user comment won't be the most reliable you'll ever read, but I seriously believe that ""Tentacles"" is NOT as horrible as everyone claims it is! Well yes, the screenplay is a shameless and unimaginative re-telling of Spielberg's classic sea monster movie, but we all knew that in advance and it surely doesn't mean it can't be entertaining, right? And ""Tentacles"" sure is entertaining with its tacky special effects and especially the over-the-top score that is used to distract you whenever the underwater cinematography is too murky to follow. The tourist community Ocean Beach suffers from an unwelcome guest in its waters and it soon turns out to be a murderous, yet normal-sized, octopus. Normally, these animals are shy and harmless but this particular critter went a little mad due to extreme vibrations in the water, coming from a drilling company that is digging a beach tunnel nearby. After the alarming discovery of several mutilated corpses, local reporter Ned Turner (John Huston) calls in the help of ichthyologist Will Gleason (Bo Hopkins). It's always nice to see respectable actors in later roles, even if their performances suck and they clearly just agreed to star to earn some easy money. Apart from Huston and Gleason, ""Tentacles"" also stars Henry Fonda, Claude Atkins and the recently deceased Shelley Winters. With all do respect for Mrs. Winters but she was the only terrible character here. At least in campy Italian horror films like this some of the deaths are unexpected and mildly shocking, like the opening sequence involving the disappearance of a baby. There's also a neatly staged sequence with the octopus vs a corpulent dude and an unintentionally hilarious sequence in which Gleason gives pep-talk to his two killer whales that are about to fight an enemy in the shape of an octopus!

It's certainly one of the most interesting as it's an Italian/Spanish co-production, but curiously set in England, and it predates both 'Dawn Of The Dead' and the subsequent Eurozombie boom led by Lucio Fulci et al. The zombies themselves aren't as gruesome and repulsive as Romero or Fulci zombies, but once you get over that you've got yourself one very watchable and entertaining take on the genre. The two leads (Cristina Galbo and 'Autopsy's Ray Lovelock) are both good. They meet while travelling due to a minor accident, become uneasy travelling companions, and subsequently find themselves caught in a nightmare of non-stop zombie action while being pursued by a ruthless cop (Arthur Kennedy - 'Fantastic Voyage') who believes they are Manson-like hippie serial killers.

So you can imagine my surprise then when I came across this hidden gem! Let Sleeping Corpses Lie does everything that you would want a zombie film to do; it has gore, shocks, atmosphere, humour, intrigue and a typically thin plot line, which allows the film to put more emphasis on the more important aspects, rather than swamping itself in needless plot details. Of course, the film does somewhat cash in on the success of George Romero's zombie milestone; 'Night of the Living Dead', but really; it's almost impossible for a post-Night zombie film to not have that comment lauded upon it, and Let Sleeping Corpses Lie has enough about it to more than adequately rise above the Night of the Living Dead rip-off's. The classically styled zombie film story follows a group of farmers that create a machine to kill insects with ultra violet rays. However, this contraption does more than it says on the tin, as recently deceased members of the public start popping up, just around the same time that George and Edna; two people that came together after an accident, roll into town."

Romero's classic `Night of the Living Dead'. On top of that, `Let Sleeping Corpses Lie' is an early 70's Spanish/Italian co-production and those movies automatically get categorized as meaningless garbage. But, if you decide to ignore this movie due to these reasons, it's your loss. You'll miss out on one of the most imaginative and clever zombie films ever made! Jorge Grau's modest horror masterpiece is stuffed with ingenious findings, strong plot-twists and adorable black humor. And surprisingly great acting too, as Ray Lovelock (Autopsy) and Christina Galbo (What have you done to Solange) form a lovely horror couple. They're stuck with each other after a silly accident and continue their trip together. Ending up in a quiet little village, they discover that experiments with ultrasonic agriculture methods have disastrous effects on the nerve systems of primitive life forms, causing babies to act homicidal and the dead to live again. The dumb cops, however, have no ears for the warnings and the Inspector considers the couple to be Bonnie and Clyde-like Satanists. `Let Sleeping Corpses Lie' is an excellent horror film with a lot of style and substance. The film contains a lot less nauseating butchering than you might expect but the few sequences in which zombies are devouring their victims are pretty damn gory. The photography is beautiful and you should be prepared for a few impressive shocks that'll hit you like a ten-ton hammer. Highly recommended to all horror fans!"

Its soon determined that everybody on Earth just might be doomed. So the military and some scientists build one of those high-tech drilling machines to go inside the Earth and fix things (it just wouldn't be as much fun if they didn't have to go somewhere like space or inside the planet). There's even a line the tries to make the journey into the Earth sound more impressive than the journey into space (like the one in ""Armageddon""). It's a Sci-Fi Network movie, so the script is paint by numbers disaster movie. There is in-fighting between scientists and military guys, there are rock-melting lasers, people die and sacrifice themselves for the good of all, and above all, there are (weak CGI) special effects.

The two biggest styles that the film mixes are a 'Road Trip' style teenage comedy and a 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' style redneck horror vibe, and while one gets in the way of the other quite often; director Michael Davis manages to keep things moving thanks to the fact that the constant shift in tone means that we're never quite sure where the film is going to be taken next. Things start out worryingly as we're introduced to two characters, both irritating in different ways. Adam is a wussy virgin, while Harley is a fat big-mouthed ""A-hole"". They're both driving across the desert to attend the wedding of some chick they both liked in high school. After a couple of strange events, they pick up a hitch-hiker, and then find themselves being chased by some maniac in a monster truck for reasons unknown..."

2664,tt0365513,/review/rw0922490/?ref_=tt_urv,"Monster Man is a small and modest production, made by a bunch of people who're obvious genre-lovers and ambitious fantasts. I really can't be too harsh on it as the goodwill and enthusiasm of both cast and crew can count on my sympathy a lot more than the uninspired and plot and  messy script. Unoriginal is one thing this film surely is since it borrows ideas from films like Spielberg's Duel, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the Hills have Eyes and even Jeepers Creepers!! Seriously, why anyone would want to steal ideas from junk like Jeepers Creepers is a complete mystery to me, but still The plot involves two lowlifes (a male virgin nerd and a boisterous, chubby joker) who're on their way to wedding of a girl they both worshiped in their youth. They pick up the inevitable hitch-hiking sexy babe, which leads to new cliché intricacies. Meanwhile, they're being terrorized by this huge Monster Truck, driven by a ghoulish and severely mutilated madman. The make-up effects in this film are playfully gore and the bloodshed is very explicitHeads and limbs are cheerfully being crushed under the giant wheels of the truck and numberless `roadkill'-corpses appear out of nowhere. The comedy-horror approach of this film reminds you about other memorable titles such as Evil Dead II, Braindead and The Return of the Living Deadhowever, I severely doubt that Monster Man will ever enjoy the same status in the field like the previously mentioned titles do. The extremely far-fetched and stupid climax is a bit too much and hard to swallow, even though I was in a generously mild and open-minded mood. Even for an absurd comedy, Monster Man has a dumb ending and that's a shame because the previous 80minutes are a well-intentioned attempt. Oh wellMonster Man will certainly be appreciated by young and over-enthusiast gorehounds and cinema thrillseekers The more trained and experienced horror fans can keep themselves busy by tracking down the references and tributes to classic horror delights.IF they're in a good mood, of course."

It's a gore-comedy basically, and I thought that it was absolutely hilarious. Very much in the fine tradition of Brain Dead (Dead Alive) and clearly influenced by The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it takes the form of a college-road-trip movie plus monster-truck fun. I thought the road-trip part of the film was far funnier than most examples of that genre thanks to 2 good central performances, a witty script, and sharp directing. Then there's the gore which is a delight, with a string of outstanding corpse-jokes each outdoing the last for bad-taste. The atmosphere in the cinema during this film was brilliant, if you like real gross-out comedy (and I don't mean someone f***ing an apple pie) you will enjoy this film."

This is one film that I'm waiting with baited breath to come out on DVD, hopefully in widescreen so I can enjoy it on my 60"" widescreen.

And oddly enough I stayed intrigued for the next 90 minutes. The humor was crude, but rarely so much so as to turn me off, and the cast was very good (sure Dennis Miller was obnoxious, but isn't that his shtick?) but what surprised me the most was how caught up in the story I became. Sure it's farcical and impossible to take seriously, but for some reason I couldn't turn it off --- I kept hanging in there to see what would happen next. Even the slightly lame-ass ending didn't ruin things for me. I'd have to say JOE DIRT beats the crap out of similar, more favorably received movies like TOMMY BOY (which I found simply unbearable).

2673,tt0245686,/review/rw0728909/?ref_=tt_urv,"Joe Dirt is simply one of those underappreciated comedies. Having reacquainted myself with it recently (and repeatedly) after having not seen it in almost two years, I myself am beginning to realize that. Not only is it thoroughly funny, it is entertaining and fast paced. David Spade plays Joe Dirt, a kind, well meaning radio-station janitor with an unusual hairdo (mullet!) and extremely bad-luck. He shares his life-story with the listeners of the radio station, which mainly focuses around his never-ending search for his parents (who ditched him on a family trip to the Grand Canyon) and his unrecognized love for hometown hottie Brandy. Joe meets many unusual people along the way, has many misadventures, and as if you couldn't guess, sets himself up for many disgusting and painful situations. The humor is pretty low-brow, but who cares? The movie is funny and that's the bottom line. What I like about this movie is that I can just turn it on and let go. The movie is so well-made for a simple comedy. Spade wrote the script himself, and you can tell he took his time. Every event in the movie happens for a reason and alludes to something that will occur later down the road. Also, Joe Dirt is Spade's first likeable character. You actually feel for this doofus. Even though he looks like white-trash, he is still a good person. Which of course, leads to this movie's moral: Good things come to good people. Or as Joe would say ""Life's a garden, dig it!"" or ""You can't have 'no' in your heart!"" Christopher Walken has a hilarious bit as Dirt's co-janitor at an elementary school that has been placed in the witness protection program and Kid Rock plays Joe's bully perfectly (I love the part where he reads the note just like those guys in high school who couldn't read past 2nd grade reading level). But Spade is the real star here. Too bad this character/movie never took off. I seriously love this movie. It is consistently hilarious, has dozens of quoteable lines (stuff that you say to people in your daily routine) and has an overall feel good vibe to it. I don't know how anyone can trash this movie. For one thing, it's an Adam Sandler production, you know what type of humor you're in for. And secondly: The movie is called 'Joe Dirt!' There are no pretensions here, folks. I wish there were more movies like this out there. And although not everyone appreciates it, I am glad that I at least have this movie and can watch it a million times if I want to. Joe Dirt, you're my hero."

Or a theater of shadows. Or puppets (which is what Bunraku is all about, as a traditional Japanese theater). Everything made of drawings, cardboard and wood, except for some vehicles (Europeans will feel some nostalgia seeing old Fiat 600 and Reanault R8 Gordini) and swords. Surreal and yet very much close to what we imagine as real. Cast is excellent, as well as direction, editing, music and camera. Why not 10 stars then?

That itself tells you what to expect from the movie. With the amazing star-cast, each one does justice to his little role with ease. The script is not demanding so the acting is sombre in accordance with the characters. I really did not know what to expect from this movie and truthfully had to look up the meaning of Bunraku in the end of the film. I was awed with the direction, it takes some really amazing talent to put a script like this on film and gt it interesting. For every penny worth, if I were 10 yeas old, I'd love the movie, I'm 35 now and love it even more. Starting from Pac-Man up to Afro Samurai and from the Wild west to Shichinin no samurai, the Script Writer and Director have left no stone unturned. The movie is very very aesthetically pleasing in context to the title. I remember as kids when we had the pop-up story books, I couldn't have imagined anything better than this movie in my head.

The acting is great, the music is great, there is some great gore scenes and a very convincing rape scene.

2688,tt0086248,/review/rw0204646/?ref_=tt_urv,"Six young archeologists set off to the desert to find sacred Indian artifacts.  One of the six becomes the spiritual embodiment of the infamous Black Claw and begins to murder(including scalping one) his friends.  Though warned by an old Indian that shakes a lot, these kids cannot be stopped in their desire to drive down the road of motion picture obscurity.  This film has next to no budget which compliments its acting, directorial, and other creative talents.  Director Fred Olen Ray directed this early work, and although the film has so many problems, one can appreciate Ray's appreciation of the classic horror tradition.  He gives meaningless roles to the serial Superman Kirk Alyn as a befuddled professor who sees the POINT-lessness of digging up sacred Native American artifacts in the end, a brief and purposeless cameo to Mr. Sci-fi himself, Forry Ackerman, and a small role to Carroll Borland from Mark of the Vampire fame.  The six stars(being very judicious with that appellation)appear to be right out of a high school play.  The only plusses any of them have is that the ladies, especially the gal playing Ellen Corman, have wonderful visual assets.  The special effects are a big joke as nothing looks real or scary in any way.  A puppet is occasionally popping up here and there to show us the disembodied spirit of Black Claw.  Night and day readily change.  One moment the players are at a campfire in blackness, another moment on a rock as the sun falls, and then back to the darkness all in the same evening.  Black Claw is one hell of an Indian if he can manipulate time and space to make that happen! This film falls in the so bad it's entertaining category.  I wasn't scalped after seeing it, but I probably lost a few more hairs!"
2689,tt0086248,/review/rw2906860/?ref_=tt_urv,"Digging the pile of low budget horror, I happened to find this piece of pure gold that shines even today. I knew Fred Olen Ray for an actor but with this one, Ray totally grabbed me in. I now salute him for his directorial abilities that gave us this masterpiece. The year is 1983 and like many others who praise the glory of the golden age of untamed slashers, most precisely the early 80s, I am going to sing my praises for 'Scalps'. Despite being a B flick, 'Scalps' is heavy on atmosphere and gore. The atmosphere is creepy and the nostalgic tune that plays during the run time is fairly engaging and makes one feel desolate. It goes along seamlessly with the striking visuals of the desert. People will say that deserts offer no scope for the urban horror where we usually have a killer who wears a mean nifty hat, muffler and a drenched raincoat, murdering the hapless victims to secure their body parts as the trophies of victory. NO! This one is surely different and a twist of supernatural combined with some good locations and a fully functional storyline make 'Scalps' unique among the other entries. The director drags us to the desert locale and shows the enormous amount of horror that is trapped there. Analyze 'Scalps' in the light of Wes Craven's classic 'The Hills Have Eyes' or Alexander Aja's remake of the same film, and you'll certainly understand my point. Deserts are cruel locations and those who have been pampered in the cities will have to learn to live again from the very scratch. Well here our actors aren't just freaked out by the tortures of nature, there is 'something' very strange in the air that's manipulating some of them to murder others and that 'something' doesn't just cease to exist as it has remained there for more than a century."
2690,tt0186647,/review/rw1061402/?ref_=tt_urv,"Often imitated, but never duplicated, this is the movie that started it all - the bombshell that sparked a revolution in action movies that continues unabated to this day. As soon as it was released you knew that no action movie could ever be the same, and indeed, the influence of ""the Ultimate Weapon"" will probably be felt 50 years hence. Gone are the days when a top grossing action flick could expect to get by on marginal acting, low brow humor, a few car chases and exposed breasts, some brief colloquial dialog occasionally interrupting the constant bombardment of seizure inducing special effects. ""The ultimate weapon"" has changed the landscape forever. So much more is demanded now. Gone are the flat, one dimensional action heroes, little more than walking assortments of infantile one-liners and agonizing clichés. Enter Ben Cutter: a character so psychologically complex, affecting emotional states so vivid and true to life, that he seems almost to jump out of the screen and merge seamlessly into the viewers surroundings. He has a tangible, corporeal presence that the audience finds difficult to shake off even after the movie has ended. The framework of this movie is disarmingly simple. The plot seems to be yet another rehash of the same tired action formulas from decades past. But the movie manages to invest all these familiar thematic elements with an energy and aura all its own, something so difficult to describe and awe inspiring to behold, that no review can claim to do it justice. The truth is I can't really pin down what makes this movie so great. I'm able to discuss plenty of other great films with others, but when ""the Ultimate Weapon"" comes up an inexplicable silence falls on the conversation, and all that remains is certain knowing and strangely communicative glances between all involved that seem to convey a common understanding, wordless and enigmatic, between those who have had the privilege of witnessing this movie."

Charlize Theron cements her talent for action cinema after MAD MAX: FURY ROAD and gives another good physical performance.

Die Hard was about one man army fighting against a team of terrorists. While in this movie he is unlikable sidekick!!! The movie is horrible digitally CGI filmed. The movie is about Russia again.

2708,tt0092615,/review/rw2580623/?ref_=tt_urv,"Where do I start about this film. I love it! As a child, the Conan movies and Clash of the Titans were my favorites. I watched everything and anything that had a warrior, sorcerer, dragon, knight, etc., on it's VHS cover.

The ""Sword and Sandal"" genre was my favorite (along with sci-fi) but was also probably the most plagued with awesome cover art that mislead you on the often crappy, low quality movies (which I still loved). And one day, I picked up the movie The Barbarians..."

The actors -- which is a loose description of what they are doing on screen -- look like they are having a ball filming this over-the-top sword-and-sorcery outing, and it's hard not to share in the fun. The heroes are musclebound, the damsel-in-distress is pretty and spunky, the bad guy is a caricature of bad-guys. What more can you wish for? "

This year is no different as Ayer explores the same territory again with SABOTAGE. But what's really interesting about his latest effort is his first-time collaboration with the former '80s and '90s king of big action icon Arnold Schwarzenegger playing the kind of role unlike anything fans have seen him before... well, at least not since 1984's THE TERMINATOR or to certain extent, 1997's BATMAN AND ROBIN."
2711,tt1742334,/review/rw2995464/?ref_=tt_urv,"There are plenty of reasons to dislike Sabotage, the latest flick starring the Governator, Arnold Schwarzenegger. It's relentlessly gory, and occasionally storms head-first into dumb, torture-porn territory. Anyone watching it for its purported connection to Agatha Christie's most-beloved mystery novel, And Then There Were None, will be disappointed - the considerably less brainy film is, at best, only vaguely inspired by the ingenious twists of the book. But Sabotage remains compelling almost all the way through, and is all the more notable for featuring one of Schwarzenegger's finest, darkest performances yet."

If you don't like these kinds of movies, what are you doing? Go watch a lifetime movie if you want story. This movie is like stepping back into the 80s and 90s of action.

2715,tt5208950,/review/rw4044173/?ref_=tt_urv,"The flick really surprised me.
It contains some well-choreographed action scenes and the storytelling is very intense.
Alain Moussi is a great choice as Kurt Sloan. The man is very skilled in martial arts and boy, this is visible on the screen.
The whole cast is superb.
I really liked the cameo of Ronaldinho and how he throw balls at Kurt Sloan.
There are some quality fight scenes with Mike Tyson as well and JCVD is simply grea as Master Durand. His character is witty and well-written.
Jean-Claude proves that he still got the moves!
There are many MMA stars that appear in the movie as well and this powers the whole fun.
What makes the flick utterly entertaining is the almost half an hour long final one on one scenes between Alain Moussi and Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson, a.k.a. the Moutain from Game of Thrones.
This is arguably one of the most terrific one on one fighting scenes that I have recently watched.
To wrap it all up, Kickboxer: Retaliation is not a perfect movie but it is more than satisfying and if you are a fan of the quality martial arts actioners, this one won't dissapoint you."

2738,tt1442492,/review/rw2304610/?ref_=tt_urv,"It feels mean to rag on a film like this, it really does. These kinds of lower budget films are such a nice way for talent to break out, film-makers to experiment, heck just for people with heart to cut their teeth. So this review makes me a bit sad, but here goes Damned by Dawn has its heart in the right place, interesting set-up and some committed actors, it gets going nicely and builds with a certain gusto to the crunch point from which all hell ought to break loose. But when crunch time hits, the film bottles it and ends up being a significant let down. The story has pretty young thing Claire (Renee Wilner) taking her boyfriend Paul (Danny Alder) back to see her folks, at the same time that her elderly Irish grandma is passing away. Her grandmother talks of the Banshee that carries away the souls of the dead, and how it must not be interfered with when the time comes. So have a guess what happens The main pluses her are a set of game actors, everyone gets involved, some get fairly physical and there's a sense that people are giving the material their all. Renee Wilner is a suitably harried, scared but determined heroine, Danny Alder is solid and sympathetic as Paul, Tarny Eva pleasant as her attractive younger sister and Mark Alan Taylor and Peter Stratford hitting the right notes of ordinary people thrust into terror and doing their resourceful darndest to keep afloat whilst bad things go down. The big problem is that not enough bad things go down, or at least not enough is shown, and the spookiness unleashed is a goodly ways from being spooky. Well I say that, the Banshee herself is a fine creation, bloodshot eyes, wreathed in spectral aura with a classy piercing shriek, as ring leader of the things unleashed on the cast she does great. But the ghouls awakened are mostly represented by CGI and are generally insipid. CGI is rarely the least bit frightening and only has good effect when either rendered by expensive talent or used for truly bizarre creations, neither of which are present here. This is just a few ghosts, some of which fly, and a few other general visual effects. Really, extras in greasepaint, or just in cloaks would have been much better and taken this film up a point in my estimation. The other big downer is that the film is unconscionably tame for its subgenre, there are a paltry couple of grisly gags, only one of which is decent. Without spookiness or visceral goods, this one gets dull despite its effortless pace, heck it doesn't even adequately show what happens to some of the cast. Put these problems together and for me they overpowered the pluses. There's little more to say, well the film has a nice location and some fun fog shrouded visuals. It may make for an OK watch on late night television, perhaps even an inebriated rental for the undemanding. But I sadly can't recommend it, quite a shame."

So I watched Priest expecting little, but while it had a fair amount of problems with it I found it decent. Is it the best of year? No. The worst? Nowhere near for me. Priest in my mind is somewhere near the lower-middle of the spectrum."
2747,tt0822847,/review/rw3577170/?ref_=tt_urv,"I saw this at the theater when it was released theatrically and I have been a fan ever since. I actually have grown more fond of this film with repeated viewings. Anyways, Priest is a very enjoyable and slick looking comic book styled action/fantasy movie that is a futuristic sci fi vampire western. Combining elements from Blade, Star Wars and the classic western, Priest is awesome and such delivers big time in the butt kicking department. This is set in a futuristic parallel universe where humans and vampires are engaged in an eternal war and battle for domination. In this retro futuristic society, the church runs the show and as such religion, government and industry are one. The vampires are faster and more agile then humans and humanity's only advantage is the sun. They are blind, insect like monsters that are vicious cgi critters that the priests must fight off with their special vatican style of kung fu. Priests are highly skilled holy warriors, similar to jedi knights, except their power comes not from the force, but the big man upstairs. This is done pretty well and the acting and storytelling are solid. Paul Bettany was excellent as the lead here, his delivery on his character is heavily influenced by Clint Eastwood and he pulls it off quite well without it coming off forced or cheesy. Bettany does well as action hero and is accompanied by Maggie Q, Christopher Plummer and Karl Urban as villain. As a whole I found this quite enjoyable and even though I much favor practical f/x, this is a total cgi fest. Even with that as a factor, the film comes off as a pretty fresh take on the vampire genre with great action and is well executed overall. Even though this is a PG 13 action film, the film is pretty violent considering and is much darker in tone than most PG 13 fare. Although, Priest plays as pretty unique it is not afraid to wear its influences on its sleeve and if you are a fan of westerns, Blade and Star Wars, Priest is the movie for for you and in my opinion Priest is much better than the Star Wars prequels."

2756,tt0060608,/review/rw2335176/?ref_=tt_urv,"""Kriminal"" explodes immediately with awesome, mega-cool opening credits. They're half comic-book and half live-action, guided by a gloriously psychedelic and rhythmic tune. This is an anti-(super-)hero movie in the same vein as Mario Bava's ""Danger: Diabolik"", and that just happens to be one of my favorite movies of all time. It's colorful, swinging, boisterous and just downright ecstatic! The plot is convoluted and you have to remain quite alert to keep up with all the plot twists. Glenn Saxson, who sometimes looks like he could be the twin brother of Franco Nero, plays the title role. He's a masked anti-hero who kills in the most incredible and imaginative ways. He seduces old horny women and subsequently boils them in their own saunas paid by they money they inherited after the suspicious death of their husbands. Kriminal is also a regular David Copperfield! He makes the best exits and I never saw someone vanish in the crowd without being noticed like he does. Last but not least, Kriminal wears the coolest outfit ever. He's dressed like a skeleton. That looks reasonably creepy and it glows in the dark, which comes in quite handy during his nocturnal escapades. Screw Batman and Spiderman, the Kriminal skeleton is the way to go! It's a bit of a shame that this film isn't more commonly known, because the outfit would make a terrific costume for kids to wear on Halloween. Speaking of which, I wouldn't be too surprised if Kriminal's outfit stood model for the character of Jack Skeleton in Tim Burton's ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". Too bad the outfit is criminally – pun intended – underused. Considering the time of release, the film is also stuffed with obligatory James Bond imitations, like sequences set inside casinos and villainous characters that resemble Ernst Blofeld. Luckily enough the script is solid and intelligent enough to stand alone as an independent success, full of action, humor and lewdness. Director Umberto Lenzi might be most commonly known for his repulsive cannibal flicks (""Cannibal Ferox"", ""Nightmare City"") and excessively violent cop thrillers (""Almost Human"", ""Violent Naples""), but this rarely seen so- called crime caper is definitely worth seeking out."
2757,tt0060608,/review/rw1898138/?ref_=tt_urv,"Umberto Lenzi is best known for his gory zombie flicks, Giallo's and Italian Cop movies; but there are a few gems from other genres dotted around his filmography, and Kriminal is definitely one of the best of them! The film is based on a comic book and follows the fortunes of a 'cartoon' criminal out to steal whatever he can. The obvious film to compare this to would be Mario Bava's pulp fiction thriller 'Diabolik', although this one is (slightly) more grounded in reality and while it doesn't have the comic book grandeur of Bava's later effort; all in all, I wouldn't hesitate to call Kriminal a better film. Glenn Saxson takes the lead role as 'Kriminal' - a notorious yet incognito thief who wears a skeleton suit and somehow manages to get the better of the police every time they try to stop him from stealing. The plot starts properly when an opportunity to steal a large amount of diamonds from a safe deposit box in Instanbul presents itself. Kriminal masterminds a plot to liberate the jewels; but first has to worm his way into several people's affections."

Taking the baseline that most people in the whole movie were newbies trying to make his own work-style in the new context of democracy, and with the ambitious idea to show up the worst side of Barcelona and get his place on the uprising ""kinki cinema"", the final result is far enough from good. The story is about a young woman trying to leave delinquency, drugs and abuses, and finding no help but deception from anyone. It is explained in plain terms and well common topics but still it fails to connect with any audience. The characters are also well defined and sharp minded, but cannot perform better in the overall movie design.

First, the action takes place in Asia instead of Los Angeles. Second, until the ending, we don't see anybody familiar. Although the hero is a misunderstood misfit, he isn't anything like the major characters in the previous films. Lucas Black plays a high school kid who is attracted to trouble, but he isn't a professional thief or a public servant. As Sean Boswell, he winds up in Tokyo and has to prove himself in an entirely different culture. Inevitably, our hero clashes with the nephew of a Yakuza boss played by the legendary martial arts superstar Sonny Chiba. Lin does a terrific job orchestrating some complicated action, especially the scenes where drivers drift. The drifting here, particularly during a town race, is breathtaking stuff. On the basis of its stunt driving, """"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" ranks as a good movie. Of course, the Chris Morgan screenplay is shallow, but he fills the action with interesting characters. Lucas Black is terrific as the fish-out-of-water hero. Brian Tee makes a first-class villain as TK, while Sung Kang is appropriately laid-back and cool as a glacier. Superior stunts, adrenalin-laced races, and a sympathetic protagonist make this ""Fast and Furious"" installment a breath of fresh air."

Michele Soavi looked pretty promising up until 1994 when he released the astonishing 'Dellamorte Dellamore', and then promptly disappeared off the horror radar. It's a massive shame that the man, up until now, hasn't followed up on his four horror films; as I, and many other horror fans (I'm sure), would agree that if he'd added a few more films to his oeuvre; he could be right up there with the master himself.

The lead story of the school teacher Miriam Kreisl, performed by Jamie Lee Curtis' older sister Kelly Curtis, who is awfully dubbed in Italian, is full of unnecessary comings and goings. A young woman living alone in a lonely place bringing a lunatic stranger home is something that does not make any sense. Everything the guy does at her place during the night could have been done while she is at school with the exception of the worm in her nose that would have taken a moment during any night by anybody from the satanic cult.

Yet, Mr. Cunningham did do a few slightly more ambitious projects. This DeepStar Six is a semi-successful undersea-monster mash with surprisingly good acting, decent special effects and a couple of good old-fashioned scary moments. The film deserves a reasonable rating, slightly higher than all other lame and laughable Ridley Scott and James Cameron wannabes. The plot involves an 11-headed crew that is about to finish up a 6-month research at the bottom of the ocean. When exploring the ocean floor, they accidentally stumble upon a hideous and relentless monster. Like it usually is the case in this type of films, it takes a little while before you actually get to see the monster. By that time, human stupidity already exterminated half of the cast.

For the last fifteen years I've owned a VHS tape of it recorded from a laser-disc version, and seen it loads of times. Today I got the Region 2 Widescreen DVD, and I was once again confirmed in my opinion that this is a fine movie. It is underwater sci-fi horror, and one of several such movies from the era, but except that it doesn't have the clout, effects wizardry and budget of a James Cameron attached to it, it manages to be an extremely well-crafted production none the less."

""The Rift"" is obviously inspired by the series of profitable underwater monster movies like ""The Abyss"" and ""Deepstar Six"". From start to finish, you can amuse yourself by spotting all the stolen ideas and shameless rip-offs of these (and other) classics. When a completely new and fancy type of submarine vanishes near the deep Dannekin rift, a second mission with U-boat designer Wick Hayes on board is sent out to investigate what really happened to Siren One. In the dark depths of the ocean, the rescue mission discovers an underwater cavern where the government secretly experiments with mutant sea-creatures. The monsters are quite aggressive but there's also the danger of a government enemy among the crew members... ""The Rift"" is a forgettable film, but it nevertheless has some ingenious  though very dodgy  monster models. Fans of blood and gore won't complain, neither, as the beastly attacks are quite gruesome and merciless. The acting is very wooden although many of the cast names can definitely do better. It's advisable that you simply enjoy the clichés and gory effects in the ""The Rift"" because, if you start contemplating about the screenplay, you'll find that it makes absolutely no sense."

2809,tt5606664,/review/rw5225285/?ref_=tt_urv,"Finally got to see my most anticipated film of the year and I'm happy to tell you it's everything I wished for and more. Flanagan has done an amazing job adapting the book from Stephen King and giving lovers of the Kubrick film adaptation of ""The Shining"" (1980) a cinematic sequel.
Now i read the book and while I enjoyed it for the most part, I found parts of it underwhelming. I feel in this film adaptation, Flanagan takes elements from the novel and manages to make them more darker and serious which in turn really helped address some issues I had with the book. He does make some serious changes though and while I embraced them I'm not sure how others who read the book will feel about them. ""The Shining"" (1980) to me and I'm sure a lot of you, is a masterpiece in filmmaking. I for one prefer it over the novel and with this film, it most certainly feels like a sequel to Stanley Kubrick's version and a love letter to that film. The last 30 mins or so are absolutely amazing and kudos to Flanagan for pulling it off.
Ewan McGregor does a great job as an adult Danny Torrance and Rebecca Ferguson captivates as Rose the Hat. The film sets a great tone with some stunning visuals and the score completely grabs you. How much you enjoy this film really depends on what you want out of it. There's practically no gore here and no cheap jump scares. What you'll get though is expert filmmaking from someone who you can tell really loves the source material he's pulling it all in from. Everything struck a balance for me that I was tremendously pleased with, top horror film of the year."

""Death Spa"" delivers everything you can derive from the title and cool DVD-cover (mine actually displays a girl's bare ass): rancid sleaze, a retarded plot and loads of gooey make-up effects. Recent widower Michael Evans runs the fancy and hi-tech Starbody Health Spa, where all the gym devices are computer-driven and sexy young girls become a member if only to get close to hunky Michael. Business is great until peculiar 'accidents' begin to take place. Michael's girlfriend Laura is the first victim when she gets heavily burned after using the spa. The next incidents are even worse, resulting in the death of several guests. Michael suspects his brother-in-law to sabotage the place, as he never got over his sister's tragic suicide, but it's more likely that Catherine's vengeful spirit returned from the grave herself. ""Death Spa"" is wacky nonsense, completely without tension or atmosphere, but the gory murders are tremendously fun to watch! Some of the cheese-highlights include a girl literally blown to pieces by an exploding mirror and another hottie melts down to the bones! An elderly guy (a cop investigating the case) even has his throat bitten open by a deep-frozen fish!!! How many times have you seen that before? Everything in this gym center is bewitched, even the cocktail blender and the bathroom tiles. The dialogs & acting performances are horrible, the typical 80's music is atrocious and all the characters are so dumb they really deserve to die. Ken Foree ('Dawn of the Dead') briefly appears as the gym center's caretaker, but his share in the plot is hardly worth mentioning.

Merritt Butrick as arrogant security expert David Avery, Ken Foree as easygoing trainer Marvin, and Rosalind Cash as the no-nonsense Sgt. Stone all do sturdy work in their roles. Moreover, this film further benefits from the smoldering presences of several beautiful babes: Brenda Bakke as Michael's sweet girlfriend Laura Danvers, Alexa Hamilton as conniving backstabbing manager Priscilla Wayne, Shari Shattuck as the vengeful Catherine, and Chelsea Field as perky diver Darla.

It's at least watchable (unlike the Matthew McConaughey ""remake""). The only thing I really don't like about it is the lack of continuity. The David Schow script is great, it just leaves out some needed information. In essence, this is the first in a long line of remakes. The director, Jeff Burr, does succeed in creating tension. My heart still pounds every time when they stop to fix that flat tire. Those far-off squeaking sounds are unnerving. The cast does well also. No one has the energy of Bill Moseley (Chop Top from TCM 2), but he's a tough act to follow. What they do have is horror favorite Ken Foree. Foree is always great. I don't care whether he's in Dawn of the Dead or The Phantom of the Mall, he's great. And you must give credit to Viggo Mortensen. He's come a long way from b horror to star in the Lord of the Rings.

The popularity of Horror omnibuses/anthologies (more or less) began with the British 1945 classic ""Dead of Night"" and had its heyday in the 60s with films such as the aforementioned Vincent Price classics or the great Mario Bava's masterpiece ""I Tre Volti Della Paura"" (""Black Sabbath""/""The Three Faces of Fear"", 1963, my choice for the greatest Horror omnibus out there), and 70s. The British Company Amicus even specialized in only doing Horror omnibuses, which resulted in such wonderful flicks as ""The House That Dripped Blood"" (1970) or ""Torture Garden"" (1967).

They mainly have to go to his house thanks to a very shaky first day of class where the professor proceeds to show everyone how nuts he is. Well they go and exchange stories, the first one being about a couple stranded near an old house that looks typical, but has the best ending of the three stories presented. The next story has these girls getting stranded in the wrong part of town and being terrorized by a guy and his Doberman. Granted, nothing really special about it overall, but it did make for the most tense story of the three and my favorite. The final one for the most part is highly forgettable to say the least. I only remember a woman who has some sort of answering service and there was no being stranded involved here, though the female did have a bum ankle. Then the movie wraps up in a somewhat interesting and somewhat absurd fashion. Not the best, but it is entertaining enough to pass the time quite nicely."

Housewife Kim Denne (Sue Lyon, far away from LOLITA [1962]) is shacked up with bitter professor Marc Denne (José Ferrer). Wait, is this a LOLITA sequel? Anyway, he is angry because she caused an accident where he has to use a wheelchair a lot of the time. So when she buys him a African-looking trinket (from Reggie Nalder at a flea market; never buy from Nalder!), he rejects it and moves forward with his plan of having his Doberman pinscher kill her while she is driving in a convertible (!). She survives, but is hospitalized with no memory and refusing to release the tiny mystical idol. Somehow it possesses her and her car (!), which rumbles around town driver-less and causes tons of crashes. I'm willing to bet Band's second feature came together after someone showed him the crazy gimmick car that looks like it has no one driving it. Oh, and after he watched THE EXORCIST (1973). Surprisingly, this beat THE CAR to theaters by a few months. The film makes absolutely no sense, but is worth seeing for some crazy car stuff. So at least he delivered on the title."

I saw this back in 1977 when it first came out on a hunch that it might be fun, and it was the only horror flick playing at the time. As I remember, Jose Ferrer is an invalid with a younger wife, and she wanted to get rid of him, and visa versa. Somehow an occult figurine with evil spirits within comes into play and takes control of a Camaro/Firebird speedster, and goes around wrecking other cars and offing folks without a dent of it's own. Obviously a Charles Band low budget take on other slicker studio occult horror such as THE CAR. It's a good example of the Charles Band exploitation style and I remember it being fast-paced and fun, without any real memorable moments, but a nice way to spend a couple of hours, and made before Band started to become a bit pretentious.

This French Languages version is unfortunately edit down. The entire dream sequence in the beginning of the movie is cut, but one cool thing is, this version is in widescreen. A few years later on I got the English UK VHS version, as far as I know, this this version is uncut. With both editions the picture is a little dusty, but the sound is OK. I have been a big fan of Charlie Band for more than 10 years now and Crash! was one of the very last of he's films to make my collection complete. I have been reading reviews about this movie before I finally got my hands on it and I must say, I was not disappointed. I think this is a great film, I just love the music in it, absolutely wonderful, mind you, this is a really strange film, even for Charlie. If you are a fan of Empire/Full Moon or just like 1970's horror, this is worth a look. I remember Crash! was on the release list some years ago, but never got out on DVD or laser disc. I emailed Charlie about this two years ago and he told me that he would love to re-release it to DVD, but unfortunately he did not own the rights anymore. This film is hard to come by, but as another IMDb user wrote, you can order it from Germany. This version should be in widescreen too, with German Languages.

The trio managed to bring some dependable class to something of a predictably mundane and clinical ghost story of a haunted skyscraper.

This sequel has its contrivances and a little mediocre in places, but it is a decent sequel, definitely one of the more watchable ones in the franchise. The script is weak in places, and the plot is something you will have seen before. Plus the pacing is rather hectic, and the film could have been longer. That said it is beautifully filmed, with lovely cinematography and even better scenery. The music score I couldn't fault either, and the gags are interesting(the hamburger contest was a riot). The acting is decent, with Charles Grodin very entertaining as George and Bonnie Hunt luminous as Alice. As the villains of the pieces, Debi Mazar and Chris Penn also impress. But the real stars are the dogs, Beethoven is still his funny and adorable self, but he is almost upstaged by the beautiful and equally adorable Missy. Overall, has its problems, but as a sequel it is watchable, certainly better than the rating here(and I also think the first film is rated too low). 6/10 Bethany Cox"

I mean, what human being would want to drown five sweet, cute, innocent puppies? When Beethoven caused the deck of Taylor's (Ashley Hamilton) lake house to collapse, I was relieved.

Things look to be picking up though as she is engaged to Bob (Gary Warner), a photographer who runs his business with former model Monica (Marina Taylor). Of course, this is NYC and you know you can't trust anyone there. This is another of Roberta Findlay's late 80s horror flicks so you'll know what to expect if you are familiar with her work from that period. Not much going on here, although it did confirm my suspicions that the gateway to hell is located in Washington Heights. To her credit, Findlay does get some nice NYC locations in and there are a couple of effective dream sequences. These bits are a bit marred by the ghost girl with the New Yawk accent though. Ed French supplied the Lurkers and they look pretty good for a low budget production. Much of the cast returned for her next production, PRIME EVIL (1989)."
2852,tt0095557,/review/rw1046404/?ref_=tt_urv,"Director Roberta Findley, wife of cult legend Michael, directs yet another bizarre, cheaply made, vulgar film. This one, Lurkers, named for the dead that can be seen by some ""lurking"" about, primarily tells the tale of a girl having a bad home life in New York in an apartment house where she sees these lurkers. We are introduced to her in a somewhat inventive and at the same time crude opening sequence where the young girl, having just been verbally/physically abused by her mother, goes outside to play and while playing jump rope - the rope mysteriously entwines around her neck as the children idly smile and watch. A young woman who will be seen later in the movie arrives, and the rope stops. Quickly we move to the present when the young girl has turned into a young musician in love with a photographer. The film then relates this relationship - but to say any more would give away the plot. And I wouldn't want to do that to you - or would I(might save you!) I think of all about this film that I did like - and granted that was not much - was the story. It is somewhat talky and you soon know where it is going, but it has shades reminiscent of Rosemary's Baby with regards to the man-woman relationship and a future conspiracy. I even thought the end, reminiscent of The Sentinel, was just quirky enough to be interesting. The real problem with this movie is that it never can shake the cheap look and feel it has. This can be easily seen in the settings, the lack of good, quality actors, and the special effects(what few there are). Christine Moore plays the lead - and she is pretty - but beyond that nothing very special. She is better than virtually everyone else in the film. Findley also has some obvious, how shall we say, peculiar interests as we are shown various scenes suggesting sexual aberration of some kind and scenes suggesting sick violence with a sledge hammer. The film is not particularly gory though. One scene that stood out for me was a scene between two beautiful models - both highly attractive - disrobing and talking about the stock market. It has nothing to do with anything yet has an interesting humorous edge as well as other pluses aimed to peak one's interest."

Some love the work, some hate it, some are indifferent, but ALL feel compelled to give up a little bit of their lives to talk about it. Here's my 5 minutes worth. Cathy's Curse is a godawful thing. A stupid plot, community theater acting, really inept production work...and yet, for all that, there's something strangely addictive about this movie. If you don't believe, just Google and you'll see. For a crappy late-70's throwaway there's a lot of stuff out there. Ask the movie poster sellers (reproduction and authentic), the purveyors of film media and the endless horror sites and blogs, Cathy's Curse is a genuine cash stream. I myself own far too many horror and giallo films and even the worst of them is better than Cathy's Curse, but for odd chemical reasons this movie truly rocks. From Beverly Murray's spooky eyes and (you would assume disqualifying) speech impediment to Roy Witham as the wonderfully drunken caretaker & semi-lecherous babysitter, I just can't get enough. There are odd character's and sub-plots that appear and disappear at random. A dog who's got it all figured out in the first couple of minutes and a white statuette that Daddy likes a little too much, but somehow never notices when it goes missing. Great stuff! The music is pretty cool too, very odd funky. I actually own 6 copies, (2 on DVD & 4 on VHS) and still haven't seen a complete version of the film because they're all different! It's a public domain hell. As of this writing all the commercially available DVD versions are cut and missing important scenes ranging from long minutes to a few seconds. Why was this done? Probably nobody knows. The missing scenes are completely inoffensive and integral to the plot. Just more mystery. Some, but not all of the VHS versions are also cut. The DVD's all seem to use the same horrible (and I mean HORRIBLE!) print. VHS copies, even those in EP are much-much better. I have a mid-80's SP copy which is a revelation and luminous but is also the cut version. I have an EP copy which is almost complete but is missing one scene of about 15 seconds that's on the cut versions! It's even more complicated but you get the idea. If you're thinking about watching the film avoid the DVD's like death itself. They're an embarrassment and the people selling them should be ashamed. It's just plain old VHS for the best (such as it is) experience. I know plenty of you really hate this movie and importantly declare it ""worst ever"", and maybe it is. But hey! Here-you-are reading and writing about it. The thing is in your head, under your skin and all over the net.

""Cathy's Curse"" just barely misses making my all time Top Ten list of worst movies ever, but not because it didn't try. Others have explained what the story is all about, so no need for me to rehash it. But to give you an idea how poorly made this picture is, I'll recount my favorite scene. It's when the old geezer of a butler Paul (Roy Witham) finds that he's locked out of a room in the Gimble mansion and tries to force his way in. The first time he puts his shoulder into the door, it opens just fine, but seeing as how it had to be a more difficult task, he pulls the door shut and tries again! Definitely a scene to rewind and watch again and again. As for the title character Cathy - cute kid, foul mouth. Actress Randi Allen has nothing on Linda Blair. My viewing copy came out of one of those DVD four-packs with minimal standards that featured a prominent greenish cast for it's entirety.

The plan works until, well, until the movie decides to get pretty surreal and defy all logic as the boss' daughter becomes a psychotic serial killer. This film certainly builds a hell of a lot of tension and leaves you guessing which direction it's going to take next, but unfortunately the direction it takes will leave you shrugging your shoulders in confusion at the same time that you're at the edge of your seat. The most disturbing thing about this movie is the reactions are so overblown. A guy kidnaps a girl just because his boss won't pay him overtime, and then the girl brutally murders a slue of people just because she got kidnapped. This is a very unsettling film that doesn't seem to have any other purpose than just to freak you out.

Another thing popular in the 80s was the slasher movie, and although by 1987 they were starting to die out it was still inevitable that a slasher movie be released that capitalized on the fitness craze sweeping the nation."

It's an amazingly entertaining and cheesy slasher flick that can't be taken all that seriously. It has everything - cheesy 80's rock music, tons of breasts, women in skimpy outfits, twist endings and ridiculous death scenes. The only thing that disappointed me was the gore - the deaths have blood but aren't very gory. The killer uses some sort of large safety pin to kill people with, which is an original but not very convincing method. The film also manages to squeeze in some samurai fight scenes, which are funny to watch. The twists are also very good and keep you guessing until the end. There's even the typical 'sequel friendly' ending. "

The acting is serviceable, for the most part, but the cast (especially the males) are so annoying, you just want them to disappear. The story has been done before, so their is nothing to write about that, but the execution is so poorly and shoddily done, I am really surprised anyone gave funding to complete this. I would have asked for my money back and shelved the project, never to see the light of day. It just doesn't do anything good enough to warrant even a curious viewing. Avoid it and forget it.

Exhumed Films calls it ""a Blaxploitation/Horror/Kung-Fu absurdist masterpiece,"" which they very correctly note ""could only exist in the exploitation heyday of the 1970s."" This gets a bit closer. You're really getting 3 or 4 different movies in one here. Possibly my favorite plot of all-time: a soul-brother karate instructor travels to Hong Kong to learn and master his art, where his buddy and protégé steals an ancient amulet which (unbeknownst to him) has the power to control a demon. The demon follows them home to NYC where it hides in the subway and begins killing innocent (and not-so-innocent) bystanders. Oh, and by the way? The amulet-stealing buddy is also a drug dealer with an ongoing vendetta against the local Chinese crime gang. That's at least 2 movies right there. The film now shifts gears to another buddy of the karate instructor, who is a cop investigating the subway killings. This portion of the film now plays like a supernatural/creature hunter/police procedural/X-Files kinda thing. Again, this could be a movie in its own right. Everything comes to a head when the black kung-fu-ers and the Chinese gang realize it might not just be their street fights that's killing off their members, and that maybe the cops are on to something when they say something is lurking in the subway, waiting to mutilate its next victim. This all ends with what is the trippiest final fight sequence since Zardoz. I would not have believed such a movie could exist had I not seen it. I *have* seen it. You should too."

This movie has some of the worst indescribably monstrous parents you could ever come across. Not an exploitation film as much as an afterschool special on the dangers of child abuse. Seemingly harmless, Mr. Rabby takes matters into his own hands when it seems the police are neutered by lack of evidence to convict loathsome parents of their terrible abuse towards their children. The children are emotionless and zombie-like(..due to the amount of abuse inflicted upon them), the parents loud, inconceivably harsh, contemptible, and belligerent. The mothers, in particular, are so obscene, you'll root for their execution. They are essentially miserable people taking out their frustrations on the kids. Our detectives are a tired lot, frustrated with the whole judicial process, how police procedure is often unable to prosecute those who beat their kids into submission. While the crimes themselves are heinous, the film doesn't explicitly elaborate the grisly activity on screen. I'd say the reason to see this is for Tom Basham's performance as the unbalanced man-child who slips into psychosis. There's quite a weird dinner table sequence between Basham's Mr. Rabbey and his guardian shortly after he murdered the parents responsible for the death of their child, regarding how he lives in a fantasy and how what he had just done has left an indelible mark(..notice the changes in behavior, pretty impressive work, going from innocent to creepy). Peter Renaday is Lt. Hayes, the detective in charge of the homicides cases, expressing on his face the strain that is taking it's toll on him. There's an early performance by John Ashton as detective Matthews, always raising the ire of Hayes because of his inability to follow directions, not to mention how opinionated he is regarding the parents abusing their kids. Awkward laid-back bluesy score that seems improper for a film such as this. Controversial conclusion establishing that even kids can only tolerate so much. A bit too slow moving for my tastes, but there's an effective use, I felt, of Basham's eyes before he takes care of business, waiting patiently as he prepares to strike."

When he discovers that some of his viewers are being abused by their parents he flips and takes matters into his own hands. Death by baseball bat, lawnmower, and strangulation are just a few of the things he has in store for the abusive parents. This seldom seen slasher is also highlighted by Basham's odd relationship with his puppets, as well as his blanket which he calls Mr.Rabbey. Psychopath also features weird music and endless close-ups of Basham's wild eyes. A must for fans of weird horror."

So, then why on earth is it still such a boring and mildly frustrating film? ""Macabra"" contains all the basic ingredients of a unique horror effort, but the elaboration is so weak and amateurish all the potential and good intentions go nearly wasted. Jennifer and Mark Baines, a married couple, invest their money in a Mexican mine and hope to get rich real fast exploiting silver. The local workers still attempt to warn them about the place being haunted with an ancient demonic evil, but it's useless. Instead of winning silver, Jennifer and Mark unleash pure evil in the shape of a mummified hand that takes control over the people it possesses. When Mark falls victim to the evil first, Jennifer teams up with a reluctant Vietnam veteran turned priest in order to defeat the hand. As said, the basic idea had potential, but a bit more background regarding the nature and origin of the evil would have been welcome. What exactly is it? Why a hand? How did it end up in a Mexican mine, etc? There are some moments of sheer suspense, fast pacing and creepiness, but even more boredom and absolute pointlessness. There's a reasonable amount of gore and typically 80's cheese-effects, including self-crawling hands and explicit amputations. The cinematography is too dark, but the set-pieces are admirably macabre and especially the soundtrack is far superior to any other aspect this overall mediocre effort. The theme music is creepy, and throughout the film uncanny tunes can be heard repeatedly. Bad film, but curiously compelling and still recommended to remotely tolerant genre fans."

This movie deserves to be recognised for many reasons. For one thing the 2 biker gangs in it (The Scorpions and The Road Agents) are real gangs; for another the music was written by Mike Nesmith. Yes, THAT Mike Nesmith, the former Monkey; and for yet another it is one of the most brutally honest independent movies to come out of the 1970's putting those glossy, sugar coated versions of biker life put out by American International to a well deserved shame.

2916,tt0089963,/review/rw3133832/?ref_=tt_urv,"Ben Stryker (Henriksen) is a former soldier who rolls in on his motorcycle into the dusty ol' Western town of Agua Dulce. He's a man of few words, and lets his short spiky blonde hair do the talking. Or, failing that, he's pretty handy in a fight. He goes to see his wheelchair-bound buddy Tick (Kennedy), and his son (?) Danny, and reconnects with his old girlfriend Katie (Udy). But breaking up all the fond camaraderie is the notorious Savages biker gang. They come to the quiet town and start raising all sorts of hell. Led by Pigiron (Forsythe) and Zero (Jones), their growing presence in the town is pushing the residents to the breaking point. Even the local bar-mistress, Rachel (Black) has taken up with Pigiron, and no one, from the Sheriff (Gordon) to Rev. Romano (Lynch) can do anything about it. That's when Stryker is pushed to do what he does best: Stryke. Will he drive the Savages out of town forever? The first thing you'll notice about Savage Dawn is the amazing cast. Lance Henriksen is very good as the sly Stryker (who's also a byker) - another in a long line of men named Stryker or Striker that we've seen over the years. He makes a nice addition to the Stryker family. And because he co-stars with William Forsythe and the movie is about bikers, this can be considered as a sort of precursor to Stone Cold (1991). But here they're at odds, in Stone Cold they're buddies. But this is like a dry run for that, and in our opinion Stone Cold is the better movie. Karen Black was in Hostage (1987) with Wings Hauser, who was...Striker. Coincidence? George Kennedy put in a sympathetic performance as Tick, and fan favorite Richard Lynch is on board as the creepy reverend. Claudia Udy of Nightforce (1987) and To the Death (1993) gets into a catfight with Karen Black, and Mickey Jones plays Zero, as opposed to Wash Pot. We think he only plays dudes with nicknames. Lockdown (1990)'s Elizabeth Kaitan has a small role, as does, supposedly, Sam Kinison (?) and with all this star-power, you can't go wrong...right? As we've mentioned too many times before, we invented the phrase ""Lone Tiger Syndrome"" to describe the incidences when you get suckered into watching a movie because there are a lot of names you like or recognize in the cast, but then the movie itself is not that great, and you realize that having a lot of talented actors on board doesn't mean the writing and directing is good. Too often the scales are tipped too far in one direction. We believe that is the case with Savage Dawn - a movie with a lot of filler that doesn't live up to its potential. Which is a real shame, because it was SO CLOSE to being a winner: Henriksen is cool as the renegade ""good biker"" with all the great lines, George Kennedy has a rocket launcher, and there's even some surprise Punchfighting, but here are the problems..."

It's up to Stryker and Rand to put a permanent stop to these nasty no-count hooligans. Competently directed by Simon Nuchtern, with polished cinematography by Gerald Freil, a decent smattering of gratuitous nudity, a funky, syncopated score by Pino Donaggio, well-developed main characters (there's a nice chemistry between Kennedy and Henrikson), and a handy helping of raw violence, this grungy biker version of the classic Western ""Shane"" makes for an entertainingly scrappy affair. The cool cast of familiar B-feature faces helps matters a whole lot: Karen Black as two-bit floozy barmaid Rachel, Richard Lynch as lecherous weakling priest Reverand Romano, Claudia Udy as Tick's tough hottie daughter Katie, Leo Gordon as the gruff, but ineffectual sheriff, Mickey Jones as evil Harley hound Zero, and wildman stand-up comedian Sam Kinison in a funny bit part as an obnoxious born again Christian barber.

But though I find Andrew Dice Clay to be a good actor, many people might see this movie and think that he is just using this film as an excuse for people to see his stand-up act. Well, like the film, the opinions are two sided. You either love the Diceman's comedy, or utterly hate it. I'm going for the upper.

On one hand, it's one of the most misandrist movies I have ever seen, all but one of the male characters being vile, sexist, violent redneck pigs with absolutely no redeeming qualities and double-figure IQs, while all of the women are hot, resourceful and able to best a man at almost anything, whether it be a baseball match or unarmed combat. On the other hand, the film is pure exploitation, Rosenberg missing no opportunity to show the ladies' ass cheeks hanging out of their hot pants or exposing their ample breasts, with gratuitous up-skirt shots and a communal shower scene befitting your average women-in-prison movie. What exactly are we dealing with here? Feminist survival horror or sleazy skin-flick?

Next comes a nice assortment of violence, including death by baseball bat, knife, crushed by a bus, gun shot, hanging, cross bow, and that old stand by, kicked down a grain elevator. This hunted in the woods classic has moments of backwoods humor, nice photography, some nifty stunt work, acceptable character development, and acting that ranges from professional (Gregory Scott Collins), to not so good (pick any babe).

A weird film altogether with a lot of great and some not-so-great special effects, including nifty looking miniatures.

I had not heard of it, which is a bit odd given that I'm a big fan of Jeffrey Combs (Mordrid) and the film isn't that old. But now it's mine and I can enjoy it again and again. The film certainly is fun in the classic Full Moon style. Richard Band provides the music (which doesn't differ much from all his other scores) and Brian Thompson plays the evil Kabal. We even have animated dinosaur bones! What more do you want? Of course, the cheese factor is high. I felt much of the film was a rip-off of the Dr. Strange comics. And the blue pantsuit was silly. And plot holes are everywhere (I could list at least five, but why bother). And why does the ancient symbol of Mordrid and Kabal look suspiciously like a hammer and sickle? Combs has never been a strong actor, so he fits right in with the cheese. These aren't complaints. Full Moon fans have come to expect these things and devour them like crack-laced Grape Nuts.

I loved the introduction from Julian Marsh III, who told of how he discovered the last remaining print in his hallway and I loved his recorded telephone conversation with second male lead, Charles W. Pitt. The film itself starts very predictably in a graveyard at night in the rain. Inside a nearby dwelling the three lost students and their teacher are given some sort of welcome by the statuesque but clearly male, Miss Leslie. Despite the fact that the central character is in drag for the entire film almost nothing is made of it. The film is rather slow but does pick up with the frantic bed swapping of the teens and their 'liberated' teacher and the nocturnal wanderings of the axe man (lady). There is corny dialogue to laugh at, an unbelievable acceptance of the goings on by the youngsters but a sinister tone is established and when the dolls appear we know we are watching something, just that little bit different.

Unperturbed by the fact that their host is clearly a man in a dress (lip-synching badly to a woman's voice), and that 'she' obviously has a few screws loose, the guests remain for the night. The discovery of a strange room housing an altar with several scarily realistic life-size figures (so realistic that they sway gently from side to side) doesn't seem to concern them. Not even the blatantly obvious dead body under a sheet has them running scared. Basically, they deserve everything that happens to them for being so dumb."

Does this movie deliver the same scares as the original Halloween or even the sequel? No, it doesn't, but it's still creepy and not given a proper chance by most. Just the song that is used alone in this movie was a bit intense. It's a great little ghost story that is sure to deliver chills if you have an open mind to it.

Writer/director Tommy Lee Wallace relates the gripping story at a steady pace, does an ace job of creating and sustaining a spooky mysterious atmosphere, and maintains a grim tone that stays bleakly true to itself right to the devastatingly downbeat and nihilistic end. Moreover, the diabolically clever premise combines horror and science fiction elements with tremendous startling imagination as the holiday's ghastly Celtic druid roots concerning mass virgin sacrifices are brought into contemporary times through the use of advanced modern technology. The filmmakers warrant extra praise not only for having the guts to kill a kid on screen in a truly sick and disturbing way, but also for providing several spot-on satirical potshots at capitalism and consumerism. The make-up f/x are quite grotesque and creative. Michael Currie contributes a hearty turn as folksy motel proprietor Rafferty, Nancy Kyes makes a brief appearance as Challis' bitter ex-wife Linda, and the engaging presence of Essx Smith as helpful gas station owner Walter Jones bookends the picture. Middle-aged alcoholic and womanizer Challis makes for a touchingly flawed average guy hero. Dean Cundey's sharp widescreen cinematography gives the movie an impressive polished look. The pulsating score by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth further enhances the overall ominous mood. Good creepy fun."

Norman J.Warren, a maverick director who knew a gap in the market (or the opportunity for a quick cash-in on an established craze) when he saw one, is actually a pretty decent director, and he gets ample opportunity to show his tightly-honed skills here, particularly during some of the more competent action sequences. The set design may be no great shakes - the film looks more like a big-screen version of the cult TV series BLAKE'S SEVEN than anything Ridley Scott put his name to - but the caverns that double as the subterranean outer-space dungeons are none too shabby and quite convincingly lit (just forget about the silly red-filtered shots of the planet's surface, so obviously shot in a quarry somewhere), and John Metcalfe's widescreen photography makes the low-budget production look expansive, if not exactly expensive."

2973,tt0080730,/review/rw1872410/?ref_=tt_urv,"Despite his reputation of being one of the worst horror directors that ever lived, I personally always felt a strange respect and admiration towards good old Don Dohler. Both ""Nightbeast"" and ""The Galaxy Invader"" qualify as terrifically cheesy entertainment (if you fancy low-budget exploitation cinema, of course) and I even daresay this ""Fiend"" is his absolute finest achievement. Sure, ""Fiend"" is a slow-paced film with a total lack of logic or explanation, but simultaneously it's a truly spirited film with likable performances, better-than-average effects and (unintentionally?) clever undertones. The movie opens with a written definition of what exactly is a fiend and immediately after we witness how a demoniacally possessed reddish cloud enters a grave on a forsaken cemetery, possesses the corpse of a recently deceased music tutor and causes the body to emerge. Where did the evil cloud come from? Don't know Why did it enter that grave specifically? Who cares? What purpose will the walking and continuously rotting fiend now fulfill? Why even bother to contemplate about that? The fiend, Eric Longfellow, settles himself in a seemingly quiet Baltimore suburb but, unfortunately, he has one little problem to take into account. His body decays over and over again, so he frequently needs to recharge his vital batteries by strangling innocent victims  preferably young women  he picks up from the streets. His neighbor with too much free time on his hands suspects Longfellow to be involved in the unsolved murder spree and starts his own private investigation. ""Fiend"" is often too slow and tedious, but the delightfully cheese and clumsily shot murder sequences compensate for a lot! Whenever Longfellow strangles a new victim, his face and hands bath in a funky red glow and once or twice you even notice how his decomposing face revitalizes itself, which was really well-done. Unintentionally or not, ""Fiend"" also works as a parody on the typical life and relations in suburbs. The neighbors are noisy and suspicious towards newcomers and, at the same time, Longfellow himself wondrously depicts the prototypical social outcast. Every neighborhood has one like that, the strange guy your mom warns you not to go near or the bastard that never returns the ball when it accidentally falls in his garden. Don Leifert, who starred in practically all of Dohler's movies, is simply terrific as the emotionless corpse. I read in an article that Leifert was going through a rough personal period and struggled with an alcohol addiction at the time of shooting. Well, this is perhaps the only time that depressions and the effects of alcohol abuse contribute something good to someone's acting career. My advice would be to disregard the low rating, skip reading the bashing reviews and forget everything you heard about Don Dohler as a director. This film is a lot of fun too watch, Dohler's direction is actually quite steady and the script contains a handful of dared twists (child's death, for example) and a shocking finale. ""Fiend"" is a genuine smörgåsbord for experienced B-movie/cinematic trash fanatics."

Fiend is consistent with the Dohler brand; put together on the cheap, stars a bunch of his friends and relatives, and is just good crazy horror movie fun.

2977,tt0101474,/review/rw4852274/?ref_=tt_urv,"First of all, what an amazing title. B-movie titles never really get subtle, but Don Dohler is playing in a whole different ballpark here. A blood massacre, that's the best kind there is!"
2978,tt0101474,/review/rw1929130/?ref_=tt_urv,"Don Dohler was known mostly from his SF/horror movies with bloodthirsty aliens like 'Nightbeast' or 'Alien Factor' 'Blood Massacre' is completely different movie and tells the story of four video store robbers who accidentally killed the owner's daughter. They are hiding in rural house terrorizing local family. What they don't know, all of the family members are sick cannibals who wants their blood and guts for a dinner... 'Blood Massacre' is one of the Don Dohler's last good movies made with good gory taste. The movie itself isn't very gory. We have decapitation, blades in the stomach, stick in the guts and some more, but honestly it's not so much for Don Dohler's earlier standards. The plot is just very similar to 'Texas Chain Saw Massacre' but with four thugs instead of teenagers. What I want to say - this movie isn't so disturbing as it should be. Anyway, 'Blood Massacre' is still very fun and easy to watch little flick. The acting is horrible, but who cares? We have some nice gore scenes(although there should be much more blood and gore), pretty nice rock music and finally very nice and surprising twist on the end. If you find this movie, give it a chance. 6 out of 10"

What could be better than the words 'chainsaw' and 'massacre' being in the same title?  The words 'blood' and 'massacre' of course. The box art was pretty awesome too, showing a head with some ribs on a platter.  How could any horror fan avoid wanting to watch a film called ""Blood Massacre"" with body parts on a silver platter?"
2980,tt0090093,/review/rw2114783/?ref_=tt_urv,"This cheesy, low-budget piece of revenge action from the Evil Dead gang might be technically sub-par, clumsily written, and poorly acted, but thanks to a genuine sense of fun, plenty of mindless violence, and a memorably OTT turn from Sam Raimi as a Charles Manson style cult leader with bad hair and even worse teeth, it actually proves to be very entertaining stuff."
2981,tt0090093,/review/rw1805682/?ref_=tt_urv,"Like all the other reviews stated clear already, ""Thou Shalt Not Kill  Except"" offers more interesting trivia details than actual good cinema. The film is somewhat of a side-project of the ""Evil Dead""-team; only the roles and duties were exchanged for this once. Bruce Campbell (co-)wrote and Sam Raimi (nowadays the acclaimed director of blockbusters such as ""Spiderman"") stars as a thoroughly depraved, sneering and serial killing gang leader. He's totally awesome in a tacky kind of way! That means Raimi is a downright lousy actor, but if you see him go over the top here and then subsequently picture him sitting in the director's seat of a $200,000,000 box office hit  it's just a priceless image! The plot is familiar revenge/exploitation camp but ever more violent, senseless and uncompromising than it is usually the case. Four buddies that fought side by side in Vietnam reunite in their Michigan hometown for some random hard-drinking, sex with minors and blasting the hell out of wooden outhouses with shotguns. Meanwhile, there's a murderous gang of bikers active in the area. They're self-acclaimed messiahs, already killed several entire families and always clad nightmarish messages on the wall in human blood. You know, lovely stuff like ""The Bloodbath is Coming!"" Real-life scum as practice-shooting targets were just what our 'Nam buddies needed and it even gets personal when it turns out that the gang killed Stryker's befriended bartender and kidnapped his high school sweetheart. The body count in this film is enormous and each separate killing is somewhat imaginative. Unlike most Vietnam-themed retribution/vigilante flicks, like for example ""Rolling Thunder"" and ""The Exterminator"", the avengers here weren't depressed, embittered or dehumanized after serving in the war. Quite the contrary, they love bringing up memories about their tour together and literally enjoy shooting up the enemy ANY type of enemy! Much more than the other entries in this sub genre, ""Thou Shalt Not Kill  Except"" is a pure glorification of violence. The filming style is gritty and very cheap, the editing and sound effects are really clumsy and the forced ""happy"" ending is truly hilarious. In other words; pure & genuine exploitation that won't get appreciated by everyone, but if you like this kind of trash and/or you want to see the other - more secret - side of Sam Raimi, ""Thou Shalt Not Kill ... Except"" comes with my highest recommendation."
2982,tt0090093,/review/rw2604905/?ref_=tt_urv,"""Stryker's War"", a.k.a. ""Thou Shalt Not Kill...Except"", is solidly amusing low budget action nonsense that definitely delivers in the laughs department. In fact, it's silly enough for one to believe the filmmakers had their tongues firmly in their cheeks. It's admittedly rather rough, in both the acting and technical departments, but this adds to the appeal if you totally dig wild and wacky B cinema. From a story co-credited to Bruce Campbell, and a screenplay co-written by Scott Spiegel, Josh Becker directs this goofy fun flick that takes place in 1969, after young man Jack Stryker (Brian Schulz) has returned from Vietnam after an honourable discharge. He's soon visited by his wartime comrades, played by Robert Rickman, John Manfredi, and Timothy Patrick Quill. It's a good thing they're around, as soon Jack will go to war with a Manson Family type cult led by an absolutely priceless Sam Raimi in a hilarious hippie wig, after the cult murders Jack's good friend Otis (Perry Mallette) and abducts his old girlfriend Sally (Cheryl Hausen). While this remains agreeable viewing throughout, it might require patience on the part of some viewers to stick it out through the first half before we finally start getting to the really good stuff, with a lot of hysterical gore and sadism. These cult members are going to get what's coming to them, and THEN some. One can see that this is a labour of love for the filmmaking family including such talents as Raimi, Spiegel, Becker, and Campbell (the last having also worked in the sound department). Raimi's actor brother Ted also turns up as the goon wielding the chain. Clocking in at a reasonable 83 minutes, ""Stryker's War"" makes for good enough entertainment, no matter if it's not a particularly good film. It earns points more for its heart than anything else. There always is something appealing about watching something made on a low budget by people just wanting to make a movie and have some fun. Seven out of 10."
2983,tt0090093,/review/rw1205629/?ref_=tt_urv,"This film has Sam Raimi as a Charles Manson-like figure with a big gang taking on a Vietnam veteran and his gang in Bruce Campbell's backyard. Tons of blood, death, and some nice gore happens. What more do you need to know? I really have nothing else to say that could make you see this. You've already made up your mind. This film is filled with tons of hilarious segments, including some army men doing kung-fu. The last 30 minutes or so of this film is just violent scene after violent scene, and here's the thing: it never gets old. I've seen so many films where the action gets pretty old after a while. After 500 explosions or so, I usually get tired. In fact, war films are probably the most notorious for this, featuring way too many deaths and action scenes and not enough compelling moments. But this film is actually entertaining in so many ways that I can't not recommend it. It's another film you'll want all your friends to watch. Just a straight-up good time."

That's the million dollar question. It leads us to question our our species, as if becoming part of a gang, where we become brainwashed, and commit things we normally wouldn't do, if graduating to murder. But in this open ended, and not too optimistic film, that's pretty gruesome, near it's finale, it's M rating pushing it, we don't find out. Bugger. David McCallum lends a fine performance as the smart hunky professor of Scientology, the real smartie, determined to get to the bottom of the killings, those cattle mutilations early on, aren't for sheep lovers. The violence in Dogs in pretty raw and frank. A younger Linda Gray co-stars before her Dallas days, as Wyner's performance as the new Scientist was strong, and actually likable in a sense.

That's like saying: this is the type of animal we're dealing with here and you already know it's serious even without adding juicy prefixes like ""Wild"", ""Ravenous"" or ""Savage"". This unjustly obscure and neglected mid-70's gem deserves a little more attention from genre fanatics, if it were only for its absurdly grotesque plot and  especially  for its exhilarating climax. There are numerous creature-features with dogs out there, most are bad (""Mongrel"", ""Play Dead"", ""Dogs of Hell"") and some are good (""White Dog"", ""The Pack""), but one thing they all have in common is that they simply featured dogs that were either physically abused or trained to be killers. The fun part about ""Dogs"" is that the animals' murderous behavior is a result of genetic experiments and therefore mankind's own damn fault! The events take place on a quite and remote university campus, where people's loyal and harmless dogs suddenly turn into aggressive animals and form deadly packs at night. A duo of professors discovers that the government secretly experiments with dogs in the school's laboratory. Based on the group spirit and communication skills of ants through the pheromone chemical, the experiments are intended to accomplish a similar reaction between dogs so that they can be used as effective weapons. The tests are a little too successful, as all dogs in the area are affected and go on a relentless killing spree. ""Dogs"" starts off slow and boring with too much wannabe intellectual gibberish nobody really cares about and overly extended character drawings of protagonists nobody is really interested in. I began to worry even more when the first couple of dog-attacks were shot in the dark and you could only a bit of groaning and barking. Yet, just when you start to accept the fact ""Dogs"" is nothing more than a forgettable and lackluster low-budgeter, the script throws all tediousness overboard and goes for sheer entertainment. The last half hour is good cheesy fun with an enormous death toll, grainy make-up effects and unintentionally hilarious situations. One of the professors tries to rescue his love interest while the other desperately attempts to evacuate the campus. Eventually the dogs break into the library  courtesy of the fat nerd who found it necessary to separate from the group in search for snacks  and massacre the entire campus! The climatic bloodbath, together with the tacky freeze-frame ending, made ""Dogs"" a viewing experience I personally can't be too harsh on. And then I haven't even mentioned Linda Grey shower-sequence! Seek out this bad puppy (pun intended)"

This is a film which manages to be pretty suspenseful in places and even - wow! - scary on occasion.

3008,tt0095256,/review/rw2502955/?ref_=tt_urv,"Grotesque (1988) is a truly weird slice of cheesy 80s horror that suffers from something of an identity crisis: the film doesn't adhere to a single sub-genre, but is a strange concoction of home invasion horror, monster movie, and revenge flick, all topped off with an absolutely insane double-twist ending. The result is far from what you would call brilliant film-making, but it is definitely loopy enough to provide an entertaining time for those who actively seek out B-movie strangeness."
3009,tt0095256,/review/rw2533702/?ref_=tt_urv,"Reasonably amusing B movie with a number of familiar faces, ""Grotesque"" was the brainchild of actor and sometime director Joe Tornatore, and it's clear that he's having a fair bit of fun with the horror genre. Ever cute and appealing Linda Blair is Lisa, who travels with her good friend Kathy (the lovely Donna Wilkes of ""Jaws 2"", ""Blood Song"", and ""Angel"") to the mountain retreat of her father Orville (Guy Stockwell, ""Santa Sangre""), a special effects artist. Unfortunately, there's a gang of degenerate punks - a common enough element in movies of this time - who are hellbent on retrieving the treasure that they are convinced the old man is hoarding. Having seen the whole thing, it becomes clear for this viewer, now, just what Tornatore and his screenwriter Mikel Angel were attempting with this movie, as the opening sequence turns out to be a movie within a movie. The balance of the thing is played mostly straight, although the way that one false scare is set up for an absurd length of time makes one think that Tornatore and Angel were making fun of this sort of thing in the first place. Makeup effects are really quite tacky but this, again, may well be another attempt to sort of wink at the audience and just have fun with conventions of low, low budget genre flicks. The entertaining cast also includes veteran matinée idol Tab Hunter as the uncle Rod, Brad Wilson as maniacal punk leader Scratch, in a hilariously way over the top performance, Nels Van Patten as giggling associate Gibbs (he may remind the viewer of his uncle Timothy's performance as the villain in ""Class of 1984""), sexy Sharon Hughes (the inspiration for Prince's song ""Little Red Corvette"") as Donna, Charles Dierkop (""Messiah of Evil"", ""Silent Night Deadly Night"") as the local sheriff, cult icon Robert Z'Dar as gang member Eric, John Goff as a producer, Tornatore himself as Charlie, and wrestling star Mike Lane (who'd worked with Bogart on the legend's last film, ""The Harder They Fall""). (It's also worth noting that Goff's long time friend and fellow exploitation veteran George ""Buck"" Flower was the movie's pre-production coordinator.) Some good shocks and atmosphere, but the movie does plod a bit too much. The final third is a bit of a surprise, though, as it goes in a direction that people might not expect - it does, however, lead to a delicious scene of revenge, even if some might feel it doesn't go far enough. Ultimately, though, it's impossible to review this and not bring up the ending, which actually completely pulls the rug out from under us - some people watching may be quite amused, others extremely disappointed; personal taste will likely decide one's reaction. Personally, I found this silly little movie quite a hoot. Seven out of 10."

John Booker attempts to resolve why his former squad are being mysteriously killed, one time the Vietnam war is over.There's a conflict-ridden love interest as well, Norris falls in love with a lovely journalist (a youngster Anne Archer) who must to save her."

Booker (the almighty Chuck Norris in solid rough'n'tumble form) and his elite squad the Black Tigers are left behind enemy lines by their backstabbing superiors during a mission in Vietnam. Five years later someone starts picking off the surviving members of the squad. It's up to Booker to find out who's behind the killings and take the person down. Director Ted Post, working from a complex and cynical script by Bruce Cohn and Mark Medoff, relates the complicated and chillingly plausible plot at a steady pace, maintains a tough and paranoid no-nonsense tone throughout, astutely nails the bleak and shadowy zeitgeist of post-Watergate 70's America, and stages the rousing action scenes with aplomb. Moreover, the story makes a grim, yet relevant and provocative central point about government expediency and corruption. The fine cast helps matters a whole lot: the charming and fetching Anne Archer delivers an appealingly spunky portrayal of snoopy investigative lawyer Margaret, James Franciscus makes for a suitably slimy villain as ruthless and treacherous politico Conrad Morgan, Lloyd Haynes does well as Booker's shrewd buddy Murray Saunders, Dana Andrews likewise excels as the bitter and washed-up Edgar Harolds, and Jim Backus has a funny bit as a cheery doorman. Norris cuts loose with his patented lethal karate moves on several exciting occasions; the definite show-stopping highlight occurs when the Chucker does a fierce flying kick through a car windshield. Robert Steadman's slick cinematography gives the picture a nice glossy look and boasts a few breathtaking aerial shots. Craig Safan's funky, jazzy, pulsating score hits the get-down groovy spot. A worthy item."

Here you have Chuck Norris, a real karate champion, plays John Booker, a war vet who is trying to find out why his comrades are being bumped off. Whoever's doing it is in big trouble. You don't mess with BOOKER! NO NOT EVER!! Many made a big mistake and it cost their own lives in the process. First, one person gets shot during skiing and Booker did the flying side kick to the Booker's assailant's wife. The major assailant put a bomb on the plane that killed his girlfriend after takeoff. And he used that ski pole to attack Booker which was no use to stop him. Then my favorite scene of all is where the same guy whose wife was taken out, gets into the Toyota Celica, and tried to run over Booker. In which he returns delivers the awesome flying dropkick to the windshield killing him. I later found out that the stunt was done by his brother Aaron. Doesn't really matter I enjoyed it all the away. Chuck Norris is the reason I got into the martial arts, and I would like to thank him all the way. He is my idol! 3.5 out of 5 stars."
3024,tt0099039,/review/rw3235514/?ref_=tt_urv,"At around the same time that Jean-Claude Van Damme was releasing LIONHEART, another European martial artist threw his hat into the ring of American action flicks. His name was Olivier Gruner, and his debut vehicle was ANGEL TOWN here. Though Gruner would be less content than many of his fellow action heroes with a simple ""karate man"" image and would quickly branch out to science fiction flicks, his debut film was a relatively typical martial arts flick, albeit with a surprising (but one-sided) emphasis on the ills of gangs in urban communities. It's not a great picture - I think Gruner's follow-up, NEMESIS, was superior - but certainly gave the former kickboxing champ a base to build on."
3025,tt0099039,/review/rw0278799/?ref_=tt_urv,"Angel Town (1990) stars Oliver Gruner who plays a Jean-Claude wannabe who's on a college scholarship to an L.A. University (does USC have a Savate Team?). He rents a room from a troubled single mother who's son is constantly threatened by a local street gang. They want him to join them but they do a very bad job trying to convince him (daily harassments and beatings). His troubles remind Oliver of his life back home (he too had a trouble past as a youth). When the gang starts to mess with him (they affectionately call him ""Frenchie"") Oliver goes ""Segal"" on those tough punks. The movie has a cheap, sleazy feel to it (but it was shot on film). The acting is either horrible (Gruner makes JCVD look like a world class actor) or over the top and the fight scenes are ho-hum at best. Surprisingly, this film is strangely enjoyable. It has an eeriness that compels viewers of bad videos to sit down and watch."
3026,tt0099039,/review/rw7583917/?ref_=tt_urv,"Angel Town is an action karate film, you have pegged as an average typical actioner, if having watched Van Damme films, or other B films. But it does you one better, and I think you'll be sort of pleasantly surprised here. Granted, it isn't a great film, but at the end of it, it left me a pretty upheld opinion of a better quality movie. A lot of it, has to do with it's likeable lead, and of course another real life karate fighter, who of course is not an actor. French hunk, Gruner was a good choice for this. He plays an university student, really stuggling for attain good uni accomodation. With very limited choice, sadly, but gladly for many other people, he resides in a East LA, gang controlled neighbourhood. I will say this, as far as gang movies go, this one was pretty scary, and AT, becomes quite an intense, and exciting drama, with some tragedies, which is all too apparent in real life. Acting is standard, poor, but we have some better players like Saldana, who of course falls for Gruner, who's taken residence in her Grandmother's house, and has become more involved in her and her son's life. Another unforgettable, great acting performance is the guy playing the impossible, rude, very judgemental, and intolerable professor. I liked the ending too, though I have seen these endings before, but I really appreciated in this. Low acting ability aside, it would of been good to see Gruner in more stuff. Near the start, before taking off to LA, is one of the most comical, original funeral scenes you'll ever see. Before Gruner's entrance, a Chicano in a car is watching, gang bullying in process, but he only reappears near the end, in the gang fight. What gives?"
3027,tt0099039,/review/rw1943166/?ref_=tt_urv,Angel Town's DVD cover may be misleading....but martial artist Olivier Gruner is the star and central plot of the film. Gruner (who also starred in the excellent Nemesis) plays a foreign exchange student who has to protect a family from a nasty gang of hoodlums. Gruner shows off some excellent fighting skills and throws out some classic cheesy one-liners. But Gruner's acting is HORRIBLE! His English sounds like a drunk Van Damme. But you're not watching this for it's great acting and dialog...you're watching this for it's kick butt martial arts action....which it has plenty of. There is a great final fight scene and the gang violence scenes are pretty shocking and realistic. The soundtrack is early 90's gold and the film has a great 90's lowbudget vibe. Excellent rental for martial arts fans!
3028,tt0066561,/review/rw2590391/?ref_=tt_urv,"Written by director Val Guest based on a treatment by J.G. Ballard, the Hammer production ""When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth"" is a good diversion that goes a long way based on the striking hotness of its young female cast members, its entertaining stop motion monsters created by Jim Danforth, and its convincing enough recreation of a prehistoric time (never *mind* the fact that we all know that cavemen and dinosaurs didn't really co-exist!). The luscious Victora Vetri, 1968 Playboy Playmate of the Year, stars as Sanna, cast out from her own tribe who develops an attachment to Tara (likable Robin Hawdon), who receives similar treatment from his own people. The admittedly episodic movie doesn't have a lot of story, but definitely delivers in the thrills department, especially in the scenes where the cavemen are interacting with the dinosaurs, among them a pterodactyl and a triceratops. One of the cutest of all has Sanna taming herself a young dinosaur. Partly filmed at Shepperton Studios and partly filmed in the Canary Islands, this always has a great look going for it, with art direction by John Blezard and cinematography by Dick Bush. The music by Mario Nascimbene is appropriately rousing. The characters, for the most part, are hard to discern from each other, except for a select few; lovely brunette Imogen Hassall is a hoot as the nasty Ayak. (If nothing else, the girl watching makes this a pleasure to watch. And it's worth noting that the Warner Bros. double feature DVD that pairs this with ""Moon Zero Two"" features the 100 minute long uncut UK version that features extremely delectable Vetri nudity.) The characters have a limited vocabulary, speaking 27 key words with ""zak"" meaning ""gone"" or ""left"" and ""m'kan"" meaning ""kill"" or ""killed"" (for example). Although it would help to have the translations, this is a story often told just as much with images as dialogue, so it doesn't matter too much. It still amounts to good visceral entertainment, with fine, consistent pacing, and creating one engaging sequence after another. Film fans who enjoy prehistoric era tales should find this enjoyable stuff, with some poignant moments amid its breathless mayhem. Eight out of 10."

3031,tt0066561,/review/rw1927701/?ref_=tt_urv,"The time: Sometime in the very distant (nonexistent) past. A tribe of evil primitive cave folks sacrifice gorgeous blonde women to the gods in order to be protected from lethal predatory dinosaurs.

When the moon appears on the horizon for the first time poor Sanna gets blamed for it and is subsequently banished from the tribe. Writer/director Val Guest treats the endearingly silly story with admirable seriousness and elicits sincere performances from the attractive cast. This immensely entertaining film offers a little something for everyone: we've got insanely hot cave babes clad in revealing outfits, cool and convincing stop-motion animation dinosaurs done by Dave Allen and Jim Danforth, muscular young men running about in loincloths, an attack by a carnivorous tree, Vetri playing with a cute baby dinosaur, men with spears fighting giant deadly reptiles, big killer crabs, fierce torrential storms, a wild beachside catfight, and, best of all, Vetri displaying her awesomely ample body in both a cave love scene and skinny-dipping sequence (make sure to see the 100 minute full uncut version or else you'll miss this tasty latter stuff). Dick Bush's crisp cinematography delivers a few striking visuals while Mario Nascimbene's lush orchestral score hits the stirring spot. Patrick Allen glowers effectively as the brutish villain Khaku. The luscious Imogen Hassall also makes a strong impression as jealous brunette spitfire Ayak. A hugely enjoyable, if admittedly preposterous picture."

It ranks with some of his other fine work, such as THE MAGIC BLADE, KILLER CLANS, CLANS OF INTRIGUE, SWORDSMAN AND ENCHANTRESS and HEROES SHED NO TEARS. Those films were based on literary works by novelist Ku Lung, while WEB OF DEATH may not be since Ku Lung gets no on screen credit, nor do I find anything similarly titled in a bibliography of his. But it sure plays like a Ku Lung adaptation, with its intertwining clan rivalries and intense competition among a large cast of characters to take over the ""boxers' world."" It's a wild, fast-paced, entertaining ride, with a host of intriguing characters played by a superb cast of Shaw Bros. regulars.

But it comes with a twist - the principal character is a guy who kills people, and his name is Killerman. Pretty clever, huh? Except that we're introduced to him as Moe Diamond, part of a money laundering duo that includes Bobby 'The Skunk' (Emory Cohen). Liam Hemsworth is Diamond/Killerman, although we're not let in on his real identity until well into the story. And even then, things become problematic when it's hinted that Moe/Frank Killerman is a cop infiltrating the money laundering racket headed by the Skunk's Uncle Perico (Zlatko Buric). We might have found out about that, but midway into the picture, Moe is injured and falls victim to amnesia. When that happened, I kind of threw up my hands and felt myself a victim of the picture having gotten that far. Complicating matters, a team of dirty cops is on the loose looking for both a drug stash that The Skunk was going to deal outside the normal course of business for his boss, and the cash that was involved in the exchange. It gets pretty convoluted fast if you're not paying attention. If you are paying attention, you'll recognize a plot hole when Moe's pregnant girlfriend winds up missing, Moe believing she's dead, but Uncle Perico stating that she's alive, even if Moe, now Frank, doesn't remember who she is. That plot thread is never wrapped up after Killerman machetes his way out of a jam involving the pair of dirty cops. A narrative following the end of the picture states that it's unknown if Moe/Frank ever figured out who he was, making it sound like this might have been based on something that actually happened.

In fact, if you like 50's and 60's Allied Artist horror on the cheap, I think you'll like this one. Remember Allied Artists was a poverty row outfit, and they could usually afford just one star. In this case it is Lon Chaney Jr. as armed robber Charles Benton, betrayed by two other bank robbers who turned state's evidence at the request of sleazy lawyer Paul Lowe, who wants a fall guy for the robbery and a chance at a smaller split for the 600K payroll heist for which he hired the three thieves in the first place. Benton realizes all of this, and the last thing he says before he is executed is that he is going to get the three who betrayed him."

Chaney's character is Butcher Benton, about to die in the electric chair for his role in a six hundred thousand dollar robbery. Masterminding the heist, as well as taking the fall is Paul Lowe (Ross Elliott), Benton's attorney. Vowing revenge from beyond (like he knew he was coming back), Benton declares ""Remember what I said, I'm gonna getcha, all three of ya"", including partners Squeamy Ellis (Marvin Ellis) and Joe Marcelli (Ken Terrell)."

I just was not able to get excited scared or involved with the film. It wasn't slow, it was just meh. Granted, I have never been a fan of Sheri Moon and I think she has taken every movie down a notch or two that Rob insists on including her in. Verily, her scenes are like some sort of music video with her prancing around all ""evil"" and cutesy in slow motion. She's clearly the centerpiece here and that's a shame because Bill Moseley is the king of horror and although he does his best with the material at hand, he can't salvage the script and the overall ""story"". New guy, Richard Brake the ""brother in law"" does a decent job filling the gap left by Sid Haig (who does have a brief appearance in the film), but it all feels very forced and lacks overall conviction.

Some of the parts though are so wooden and too convinient, you wait it would be shown as a movie footage, but then they show that these are the ""real"" events (like the episode with the officer, very convenient arrival of the policeman and killer appearing out of nowhere). The character motivations are also pretty weak, too many killers and it's too obvious that such isolation from the world is definitely not about ""concetrating on the work"". "

The plot of his ultra-low budget quickie is mundane and unbelievably predictable, yet the whole film is stuffed with ingenious little twists and elements that make the premise feel fresh and original nevertheless! There are very few directors out there, apart from Corman, able to achieve this! Susan Cabot, who starred in a handful of contemporary Corman productions, plays a businesswoman leading a prominent cosmetics company. She's unable to accept her own natural ageing process and righteously fears that her looks will bring down the monthly profits. When a scientist announces that he developed a rejuvenation liquid by extracting enzymes of ordinary wasps, Janice Starling immediately wants to commercialize it and test it on herself. The miraculous discovery is highly efficient, but when Janice injects herself with too much doses, she transforms into a murderous wasp overnight. ""The Wasp Woman"" is no more or no less than fun & undemanding Sci-Fi entertainment! The film has a good pace and there's the occasional suspenseful moment to enjoy. The monster-transformations and special effects are really tacky but what else did you expect considering the money that was involved? This charming little movie may not be very appealing to the younger generation of fans, but I warmly recommend it to admirers of classic science fiction. The rating here on IMDb is WAY too low!"

However, his father (Otto Kruger) isn't about to let this happen and he manages to keep the brain alive in a weird aquarium-like contraption.

3072,tt0051484,/review/rw3264628/?ref_=tt_urv,"This movie has some very intriguing implications. Of course, we have to take the medical advances and the technology as possible. Ross Martin is one of the world's greatest hopes for finding a way to feed the exploding population. On his way to accept what is probably the Nobel Prize (they change the name) he chases a little toy airplane, blown out of his son's hands by the wind, and is run over by a truck. His father, one of the foremost brain experts, working in tandem with his brother, manages to remove his brain and hook it up to machinery and ultimately to a robot that gives it mobility. He is a zealot and harsh, self-centered character, who feels that he gets to make the rules. He has never respected the other son and treats him like a small child. This man is himself an engineering genius who has contributed greatly to his late brother's success with little credit. What the ""mad scientist"" (which isn't really an accurate term) forgets is that the brain now lies in the head of an unfeeling machine. This leads to depression and thoughts of revenge. There is still a connection to the wife and the little boy, and when the brother begins to try to make his way into the family (with little success), jealousy gets the best of him and he commits fratricide. Instead of seeing himself as the salvation of the world, he begins to see humans as inferiors who need to be eliminated. He develops two abilities. One is the ability to connect with people (to locate them through ESP) and the second is a death ray which allows him to kill innocent people. He becomes overwhelmed with anger at the drop of a hat.

For just about the rest of the movie, the Colossus stays on a country estate near the city. Though it might have been more fun to show the Colossus on more of a rampage, the movie is still enjoyable. Certainly, there are some unintended chuckles, like the primitive science used to construct the Colossus. But there are actually some genuinely good moments here and there. The scene where the Colossus is first activated is both creepy and intriguing. And there are some pointed questions as to if the scientists are doing the right thing or not. Though the movie is cheap, there is some real atmosphere in part with the piano musical score, which gives this movie a really different feeling than other sci-fi movies of this period. Don't get me wrong - this isn't some intelligent masterpiece. But it manages to catch your attention, and at 70 minutes does not overstay its welcome."

3079,tt0091380,/review/rw0234492/?ref_=tt_urv,"I have to say that I loved Ray Dennis Steckler's ""Hollywood Strangler Meets the Skid Row Slasher,"" and was pretty excited to get my hands on this so-called sequel.  Unfortunately, even with about four decades of poverty-row filmmaking under his belt, 'ol Ray hasn't gotten any better at wielding a fine-tuned script.  ""Las Vegas Serial Killer"" marks the return of Jonathan Glick (played once again by Pierre Agostino), as some ridiculous circumstances release him from prison (funny, I thought he looked pretty dead at the end of ""Hollywood Strangler""), only for him to wreak havoc on the homely females of Las Vegas (the 'dancers' in this flick are pretty frightening and out-of shape).  Meanwhile, two dumb biker types are zipping around Vegas in their red car, commenting on women's legs in between bouts of purse-snatching & robbery; throughout this exercise in futility, I was hoping Glick and the bikers would somehow tie into each other, and they do, in one of the most preposterous endings I've ever seen.  This standard-issue Steckler experience seems to have been shot, with a plot (if it can be called that) inserted in post-production, where a radio commentator tries to string a nonsensical chain of events together (in one lame scene, the music on the radio continues to play even as the narrator interrupts with a 'news flash'); characters don't speak unless their backs are to the camera or they're off-screen altogether (this gets very irritating very quickly), not that anything they say is relevant.  Despite the stupid plot and ridiculous ending, there are some positive aspects to this low-budget mess: Steckler's Zapruder-esque cinematography is still raw and fascinating to watch (though the movie often threatens to turn into a LV travelogue), with a penchant for tourist attractions and parades; Agostino has a definite presence as the Glick, and to see him working in a pizza parlor is a laugh riot (though is it conceivable that every woman he meets would want to 'do' him?).  But a major component of this film's failure is a lack of Carolyn Brandt, who played the ""Skid Row Slasher"" of the original and had a charisma and sex appeal that none of the characters in this film can even approach.  As a fan of ""Hollywood Strangler,"" this movie is a huge disappointment, and for non-fans, it's bound to be much worse."
3080,tt0091380,/review/rw1058004/?ref_=tt_urv,"For starters, you just can't film your actors and then dub all the dialogue during post-production. It looks and sounds absolutely ridiculous. Luckily, or unluckily, it doesn't affect the quality of this film."
3081,tt0091380,/review/rw3535449/?ref_=tt_urv,"In the pantheon of bad filmmakers, there are a handful of names that rise (or fall?) above the rest. Ed Wood. H.G. Lewis. Al Adamson. And another such name is Ray Dennis Steckler, the man behind such enduring classics as The Incredibly Strange Creatures That Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies, Rat Pfink a Boo-Boo, and The Lemon Grove Kids Meet the Monsters. After that string of wretched but harmless trash was released in the 1960's, Steckler's films started taking on a darker tone, perhaps reflecting the changing mood and tastes of the times. Eventually he devolved into directing hardcore porn films, although he would still occasionally release slightly less tawdry fare. Las Vegas Serial Killer is one such production, although its quality is even more substandard. A late middle-aged photographer wanders around Las Vegas, strangling random dancers, prostitutes and models as he crosses paths with them. Meanwhile, a pair of guys in matching black T-shirts and sunglasses also wander around Las Vegas, occasionally robbing tourists and business owners at gunpoint. A voice-over radio announcer keeps the viewer up to date with the manhunt for the killer and the robbers. Most of this 76 minute wonder is comprised of stock footage of the Las Vegas strip, a rodeo, traffic, and bad showgirl dancers. A lot of it looks at least ten years older than the film's release date. For only the most self-loathing film addicts. Steckler writes and directs under the pseudonym ""Wolfgang Schmidt."""

You barely notice its presence, but at the same time it's intensely irritating. This is supposed to be a sequel to 1979's ""The Hollywood Strangler Meets The Skid Row Slasher"", but somehow it's even more boring than that one. The thing is, at least the original had two serial killers going for it. You had a scene where the strangler strangled a girl, then one where the slasher stabs a hobo: rinse and repeat until you finally have eighty minutes. Unfortunately the skid row slasher isn't in this one, she's replaced by two muggers who stand on a street corner and make sexist comments for the entire movie.

Thus begins Lucio Fulci's most notorious film ""The New York Ripper"", the most misogynistic film this side of William Lustig's ""Maniac"". Police detective Fred Williams (Jack Hedley) is after one sicko who cuts pretty women up in the cruelest fashion. The killer's Donald Duck voice is ludicrous and annoying, but the rampant nudity, over the top gore, red-herrings and the ultra-sleazy atmosphere make up for that in spades. It doesn't hurt that this is tightly scripted and nicely filmed either. This would be the last film in the second (and starting with ""Lizard in a Woman's Skin"" best) era of his three part career. The last and worst part would start with his next film ""Manhattan Baby"" "
3086,tt0084719,/review/rw0196823/?ref_=tt_urv,"I had heard of Lucio Fulci for years through mail order catalogs, interviews in genre magazines, and newsgroup discussions. I just decided yesterday to shell out $15 to buy the Anchor Bay video version of ""New York Ripper"". I am a huge video collector and the clamshell box with the lurid cover art just called out to me. Well, I popped it into the VCR after not eating any dinner (to disallow any possible barfing!) and watched the video. Though the gore is plentiful and there are some downright sleazy scenes, I thought this was one of the best ""giallo""-type crime films I've ever seen! While not as violent as I thought it would be, there are plenty of graphic murders to squirm at. The worst by far was the murder of the detective's prostitute ""girlfriend"", including savage razorblade attacks on her nipples and her eyes! Despite the other reviews that say there is a lot of sex, there is only one real sex scene, the rest is heavily implied. As for misogyny charges, I think the film isn't misogynistic, just the killer. And this is never explained, so I guess the film could be a tad anti-woman, but I didn't really see anything expressing this feeling that I wouldn't see in any other slasher film. The widescreen version is the best one to see, it displays Fulci's gorgeous cinematography in full and makes the film look a little more classy and sophisticated than it should. The performance of Almanta Keller as Fay, the heroine, is one of the best I've seen in Italian horror films. Her dream sequence is another disturbing visual sequence that might leave your dinner in your lap! What more can I say, I love this movie, it is sleazy, it is violent, it is controversial, but the atmosphere and style of Fulci's filmmaking more than makes up for it."

3093,tt0076191,/review/rw1185507/?ref_=tt_urv,"""The Incredible Melting Man"" is a fantastically gross, trashy and energetic Z-grade production that every self-respecting camp-horror freak simply has to see for him/herself! The ideal way to describe this low-budget 70's gem is like a shameless copy of Hammer's ""The Quatermass Xperiment"" ...only a thousand times filthier! Astronaust Steve West is the only survivor of a disastrous space-mission, but turns out the carrier of a horrible disease that makes him radioactive and ... causes him to melt! In shock after seeing his face in the mirror (can you blame him?), Steve busts out of the hospital, leaving a trail of sticky pus and fallen off body parts behind. Doctor Ted Nelson has to find him urgently, as the disease also set Steve up with an insatiable appetite for human flesh. The premise may sound utterly stupid but this flick is enormously entertaining and contains great make-up effects from the hand of Rick Baker. The melting dude's face looks like a rotting pizza and his heavy breathing makes him sound like Darth Vader! Another big advantage is that William Sachs' screenplay doesn't waste any time on tedious scientific explanations or emotional speeches. The repulsiveness starts right away and lasts until the very last moment of the film. Just enjoy this silly horror gem and try to switch off your brain activity as much as you can because, if you start contemplating about the many stupidities in the script, you'll miss out on all the campy fun!"
3094,tt0076191,/review/rw3847126/?ref_=tt_urv,I first learnt of this film's existence by walking past a cinema at the tender age of 4 and seeing a poster for the double bill of this and a TV movie that was shown theatrically in the UK called The Savage Bees (to be reviewed tomorrow night). Even the poster for this genius double bill of terror messed me up psychologically as I was obsessed with the idea of the villains of both films coming to get me when I was least expecting it.
3095,tt0130216,/review/rw2276192/?ref_=tt_urv,"This offbeat little curiosity happens to be one of my absolute favorite slasher films. In fact, only 1974's ""Black Christmas"" (which is also my pick for best of the horror genre in general) beats it. Released mere months before Carpenter's ""Halloween"" would kick start the core slasher movement, it's an extremely eerie picture. There's a sense of the foreboding here that is more prevalent than you'd expect. It focuses on a mysterious morality killer who tricks a group of ""undesirables"" into attending a fake high school reunion, only to begin picking them off once they arrive. If you think this sounds a bit like ""Slaughter High"", you'd be right. This came first and is the infinitely better of the two. It's religious subtext alone makes it far more intriguing than that popular, but ultimately quite bland effort."
3096,tt0130216,/review/rw4468373/?ref_=tt_urv,"As a life long horror fan I had heard of The Redeemer but it wasn't until I recently read an article about it that it stirred my interest. Coincidently a VHS copy came up for sale. Intrigued, I simply could not resist!
Six former students are invited to a school reunion 10 years on but one by one they are killed by a mysterious man who takes several guises. He is The Redeemer. This is an early slasher movie, made 2 years before Halloween, but it also contains religious/supernatural elements. It was made on an obviously very low budget with a cast of unknowns, the plot is also pretty confusing and at times illogical. So I appreciate people's negative reviews. However, I found it strangely enthralling and creepy. The synth score adds to the atmosphere. I think the acting is good enough considering. It's one of those films that some viewers will just write off as rubbish, whilst others - such as myself - will want to know more about it. Watching it on grainy VHS was a treat. And I will certainly be popping the tape back into the VCR again!"
3097,tt0130216,/review/rw0504089/?ref_=tt_urv,"I for one enjoyed this little known film, first having seen it at a friend's house way back when VCRs were for people who had a bit of extra money to burn and were the darlings of the neighborhood. We were really blown away by The Redeemer since there just weren't that many great horror films showing at theatres or on home video at the time. Just notice how those of us who appreciate The Redeemer were young at that time and those who don't like it are young NOW and weaned on flashier ""horror"" fare that are really Tommy Hilfiger ads in disguise."
3098,tt0130216,/review/rw0504105/?ref_=tt_urv,"I noticed here on IMDb.com, that nearly every low budget horror film that I have merely enjoyed or even thought to be spectacular has been given a bad review. To me, The Redeemer:Son Of Satan is an incredible film. It has gaillo qualities... very atmospheric, creepy, yet it doesn't need a whole lot of blood and guts to keep you interested. A stereotypical slasher film this is not. On VHS, the title of Class Reunion Massacre was most likely used to cash in on the whole slasher trend of the 80s. I found the cinematography to be incredible. The acting wasn't bad either. This isn't your regular 'piece of cheese' horror film. It was shot well, and overall, had good production values. It does have its 'cheese' moments, as most films of the genre do, but I can look beyond them. Also, I'm sure this film had a political subtext AGAINST Christianity. Showing how a crazed religious fanatic (the priest) committed murder under the justification that he was eliminating those who sinned. I also believe that the character of the little boy from the lake was the apprentice of the priest. Thats how his character comes into play. I really wish the director kept making horror films, he could've done something incredible. Love it or hate it, this film is MEMORABLE. It is Not some shoddy piece of garbage that you want to forget. All in all, The Redeemer:Son Of Satan isn't just another over-the-top slasher gore-fest. Its something more. So what if The Redeemer isn't as polished up as a squeaky clean ""Scream"" or ""I Know What You Did Last Summer""? Cant find redeeming values in a low budget film? Stick to your million dollar Blockbuster horror."

So before Robert Forster and Joe Spinell teamed up in William Lustig's ""Vigilante"", they together starred in this urban crime/revenge flick that is very well done for what was made on a minor budget and quick time frame. Holding a raw, taut edge the story was a little more thoughtful in the way it came across, unlike many rash and downright average exploitative revenge films that flooded the times. It's more talkative than expected. However it still had a punishing intensity, and moments of gutsy violence and suitably sardonic humour. Lending to the deep-rooted feel is Jay Chattaway's funky, upbeat blues score. Although what really makes the movie has got to be Forster's strong, detailed central performance, and likewise Spinell's excellently scummy head thug. Nancy Kwan has a potent presence too. The support cast; A Martinez, Wayne Woodson and James McIntire are reasonably fine."

3102,tt0086566,/review/rw0206549/?ref_=tt_urv,"You've got to feel a little sorry for Nancy Kwan's character at the beginning of ""Walking the Edge."" She's just found out that her husband has been pushing drugs to school kids, and then watches as that husband and her young son are snuffed out by a quartet of L.A. thugs. She escapes from this carnage, only to suffer a mental breakdown and subsequent institutionalization. And that's just the first five minutes of what turns out to be a fairly standard revenge story, but one graced by fine acting from Robert Forster and the inimitable Ms. Kwan. Forster plays an average-Joe guy, the type he excels at; he's a part-time cabby and also a runner for a numbers racket. Like the Nancy Kwan character, life has pushed him around a bit too much lately: His old lady has been cheating on him, he can't muster the gumption to lean on bad debtors, and he doubts whether he will ever become a Big League pitcher, his dream. But when he gets involved with Nancy's revenge scheme, his life takes a sudden turn... I'd like to say that this movie was well-done fun, but the fact of the matter is, although I enjoyed it up to a point, I am still objective enough to know the smell of cheese when I sniff it. Yes, the acting is adequate, as is the editing, and the directing (by Ms. Kwan's husband), but still, something was missing for me. Perhaps it's the fact that the script contains an unbelievable amount of cursing and profanity. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not a prude when it comes to language. But when every other sentence is ""F that"" and ""Mother this,"" it gets a bit redundant. The next time I see this movie (if there is a next time), I think I'll try counting just how many obscenities there are. My rough guess would be around 350. In addition, the vengeance that Kwan and Forster take on the thugs at the end of the film is waaay to simply accomplished. Granted, these bad guys are a bunch of real goofballs, but Forster and Kwan have a much too easy time of it. Just about every character in this film is either a thug, a drug addict, a hooker...certainly no City of Angels, that's for sure! The film also features gory shots of shot-up victims, a drill-torture scene, multiple knifings, fisticuffs, and loud punk rock. This is a far cry from Fred and Ginger doing ""The Continental,"" but for some people, hey, ""That's Entertainment""! I'm trying to be objective here, but the fact of the matter is, the mere presence of Nancy Kwan in any movie is enough to guarantee me a fun time. Nancy, 44 years old in this movie--and more than twice her age in her yummy ""Suzie Wong"" debut--looks absolutely stunning. What a physiognomy! What zygomatic bones! The high point of this film, for me (and this should tell you something about the film in a nutshell), is when Nancy, injured after having had a hubcap ""Frisbee'd"" into her ribs, takes off her blouse and stands around in her bra. Does anyone out there know how to say ""Be still, my quivering gonads"" in Chinese?"
3103,tt0069855,/review/rw2598417/?ref_=tt_urv,"The first made for television collaboration between Psycho scribe and all round pulp horror titan Robert Bloch with classy b-horror veteran Curtis Harrington, The Cat Creature is a charming if inconsequential affair that neither reaches the levels of its influences nor surpasses its status as a made for television production, but is still perfectly good stuff for a dull afternoon left sparing. The outlandish plot sees an antique theft from a deceased collector result in the release of a murderous acolyte of the Egyptian cat goddess Bast, and cop Lieutenant Marco teaming up with Professor Roger Edmonds to figure out what's going on. Then there's occult shop owner Hester Black and her assistant Rena Carter getting involved in things as well. The vibe hearkens back to horror and detection stories of yesteryear, particularly the 1940's and Cat People, with a measured pace and restrained action as well as certain pleasing subtleties. Director Harrington pulls off a few effectively creepy stalking sequences and deploys the titular beast in fun if slightly repetitive fashion. Fortunately the story has a few twists and turns so things never get dull, although they fail to get all that heated either. The cast is fairly well handled and thread things through nicely, Stuart Whitman is suitably gruff and no nonsense as Lt. Marco, Meredith Baxter paints Rena in sympathetic shades of confusion, fear and yearning, while David Hedison takes a while to warm up and loose his awkwardness but is still likable as Prof. Edmonds, a classic academic good guy figuring things out with open-mindedness and learning. Best though is Oscar winner Gale Sondergaard as Hester, crooked and controlling, time soured and radiating low key negativity yet at the same time open and helpful. She steals every one of her scenes and brings an unaffected old fashioned class to things that is perhaps the films greatest asset. It's just a shame that the film doesn't really have enough in the way of atmosphere or shocks (being rather tame even by made for television horror standards), so for all that it has in the way of style and vacant likability it just isn't all that compelling. Certainly watchable, but definitely a film for fans of television horror of the era rather than more casual fans, who may quite reasonably be bored and unimpressed. As a fan of such horror then I give The Cat Creature 6/10 and partially recommend it to other such fans, but it is far from essential."

However, what lessens the films enjoyment for me seeing it again is the appearance of abuse of cats, with an unnecessary plot device of alley cats surrounding and eventually attacking the priestess. It appears the cats were starved to congregate around the victims and thrown onto the victims, a lot like what was done with rats in Willard.

It takes itself too seriously, where chop suey kickarse action, takes a backseat between long bores and snores for some, and you can see it that way, but the serious element, only enhances the quality. The Octagon does have a few things going for it, like the extra hot Karen Carlson, a beauty who just sizzles up the screen, and enlists help of badarse bodyguard, Chuck, who doesn't put in a half bad performance, but there's still that stoic acting seeping through, and is outweighed by better actors and performances like Carlson's, and Art Hindle's, but Chuck holds his own. Hindle (Porky's) who plays Chuck's best buddy, AJ, is a real engaging reck-loose, fly off the handle character, and gives the downplayed movie, the buzz it needs. Carlson is on a personal mission of revenge, sort of using Chuck, who's mission here, hits a little too personal, as involving former family members. The Octagon is kind of patchy too, not a total clear path of story, and action fans, will fare better, renting many other Chuck flicks. Some quite heavy blood spilling violence, early in the peace, and again Lee Van Cleef is wasted as Chuck's former protegee, an old buzzard with an iron will, and is underused here. What's bloody annoying here, is the unnecessary use of Chuck's echoing voice overs, that echo that annoyance, I got out of all those QT'S unnecessary V.O'S. in Once Upon A Time In Hollywood. Here, it just adds self consciousness, and amateur feel, and this flick is a little self conscious. Watch out for fine character actor, Tracey Walter in a scene stealing cameo.

Meanwhile, Mark's younger brother Tom (Tom Skerritt) comes to the rescue and he tries to defeat the forces of Satan by stealing the Devil's Rain; a glass urn containing the restless souls of all the people who joined the cult during the past 300 years. An overlong flashback  taking us back to a genuine 17th Century witch burning - finally explains the motivations and fury of each and every character, but the plot only gets dumber and less menacing as it approaches the finale. The story soon plunges into ludicrous occult ceremonies where Borgnine transforms into a hideous goat (!) and particularly the infamous climax needs to be seen in order to be believed, as it's one gigantic slimy and gooey melting-orgy. The make-up effects are pretty damn amusing and over-the-top disgusting, especially when the eyeless faces start turning into sticky puddles of green hodgepodge. ""The Devil's Rain"" has an impressive cast and one can't help but wonder how all these stars ended up in a trash-masterwork like this. Their performances, however, range from uninterested (Eddie Albert) to downright hammy (Tom Skerritt) and Ernest Borgnine overacts like as if he's possessed by the devil for real. Apparently, Anton LaVey, the founder and high-priest of the actual Church of Satan, made some extra money as the 'technical adviser' of the film. What did he do? Give instructions on how to sacrifice virgins to Satan without spilling too much blood on your garment? Advise Borgnine how to comb over his hair in order to look more like a goat? Either way you look at it, ""The Devil's Rain"" is an incredibly strange and curious little film. Even in its decade of release, when horror was an experimental genre and boundaries kept on getting crossed, ""The Devil's Rain"" is somewhat of an outsider. I strongly suggest every open-minded horror fanatic to check it out, if only to experience suspense, laughter, disbelief and utter camp all in one film!"

The clichéd plot instantly rips off CARRIE with a gender-bending variation on the central theme: a boy at military school is tormented and abused by fellow pupils and teachers alike, so takes revenge by summoning down the wrath of Satan upon them. The best method to do this? By using his badly dated '80s computer, of course! One of the few films to contain an evil computer as one of the leading characters, EVILSPEAK makes great and cheesy use of this premise to spread some maximum mayhem come the finale."

You know him, he's the irritating and goofy looking dude who often appears as a meaningless side-character in even more meaningless horror films (The Dentist part two, the Humanoids from the Deep TV-remake etc) I doubt many people are fascinated by his career but 'Evilspeak' is amusing to watch, nevertheless. The plot is an umpteenth variant on the favorite 80's theme where the nerdish school kid who always gets picked on avenges himself. Clint shines as the loser in this case, an unfortunate military cadet always punished by his teachers and an easy target for the other, more successful cadets. 'Evilspeak' goes beyond the standard horror format when ancient demons are summoned through a computer in the basement (?) and the whole thing becomes completely hilarious when hungry, filthy-looking pigs are used as murder weapons. Although not an intended trump for a horror film, 'Evilspeak' is incredibly funny! Especially the last 10 minutes are a must in case you're in desperate need of a laugh. The climax is exaggeratedly gore, with an outrageous Clint Howard chopping off heads in a church and unleashing pigs upon his hated classmates. Cheesy make-up effects and a deranged protagonist. Sometimes that's all there is needed to brighten up your mood."

Which they have told earth through radio waves that they actually plan to visit earth. Although something goes wrong in their attempt and an expedition is sent to Mars to find any survivors. In which case they discover a green skinned lady. On their trip back the crew encounter that their new passenger has a deadly fixation for blood. 
3140,tt0060877,/review/rw0095068/?ref_=tt_urv,"Sometime in the 1990's I believe, the Earth has sent many ships to space and is awaiting the arrival of an alien to Earth after sending various stress signals.  A crew of three astronauts(including a young Dennis Hopper and Judi Meredith)go to their planet when some kind of problem arises.  It seems this race is dead or dying, and the scientists on Earth want to explore their culture and, unbeknownst to them, their anatomy.  Another expedition is needed to go after the first with two more astronauts led by John Saxon. In control at home is Doctor Farraday, played with enthusiasm by Basil Rathbone.  What the astronauts find on this dying planet(actually one of its moons) is a creature that is horrific yet strangely sexually hypnotic.  The creature is in definite female form wearing what has to be one heck of a tight body suit that shows every...and I mean every curve, peak, and valley. Florence Marley plays this vision of beautiful horror.  Her face is green and her hair rises up like some kind of testy beehive.  She says nothing but acts with her face and facial movements.  One side note about this alien presence.  It feeds on blood.  Well, you can guess what happens to sundry members of the crew as she/it vampirizes them.  The innovative part of the script is that most of the people in charge are more concerned with saving the ""beast"" for the acquisition of knowledge rather than the, in many cases their own, preservation of life. This is definitely something laced throughout the Alien movies.  Queen of Blood is a very innovative film that uses some insightful direction from Curtis Harrington with what looks like an obviously small budget.  Harrington used clips from a Russian scinece fiction film to show the rockets and other large scale sets.  But despite its small budget, Harrington manages to create a film that is haunting, eerie, and strangely beautiful, not to mention adding some good scares and some thought-provoking questions about science and its ends.  He uses colors most inventively...blue, red, green hues all over.  The acting is adequate. Its fun to see Mr. Rathbone, although he looks very tired and old.  Mr. Sci-Fi himself, Forry Ackerman, has a bit part and oddly enough the best scene in the film at the end...a real unexpected climax.  Be sure to give Queen of Blood a try...the first half or so is somewhat boring and slow, but it does pick up and I think is an excellent foray in the world of intelligent sci-fi."
3141,tt0060877,/review/rw0095076/?ref_=tt_urv,"Is 'Planet Of Blood' a good movie or a good bad one? I've watched it three times this week and I'm still not sure. The print on the DVD I bought was lousy, yet there looked like there were some impressive visual images for a 1960s b-grade sci fi movie. The acting was variable to say the least, ranging from inept to quite good. The script has some silly moments and the whole movie is incredibly dated, yet there was a few genuinely creepy moments. Good, bad, camp, forgotten gem, however you describe this movie there's one thing for sure, it's entertaining! It's certainly an improvement on AIP's goofy 'Voyage To The Prehistoric Planet', released the previous year, which was also directed by Curtis Harrington, produced by Roger Corman, and included stock footage recycled from a Russian SF movie. Both movies also featured Basil Rathbone in small supporting roles. The main reason most people (myself included) will hunt this one down is to see cult favourites John Saxon ('Enter The Dragon', 'Cannibal Apocalypse') and Dennis Hopper ('Easy Rider', 'Blue Velvet') co-star as astronauts. Saxon (""That's one bad thing about space trips - no banana splits!""), Hopper, Judi Meredith, and Don Eitner are sent on a mission to Mars to retrieve a crashed alien space ship. The year is 1990(!) and man has unsuccessfully searched for life on other planets. Unexpectedly alien transmissions are received, but the alien ship crashes before it can reach Earth.  Saxon and co. eventually find a survivor, a mysterious green skinned female (Florence Marley), who they rush back to Earth. That's when the trouble starts... 'Planet Of Blood' is lots of fun for fans of 1960s SF, Roger Corman, John Saxon and/or Dennis Hopper. p.s. Keep an eye out for Forrie Ackerman!"

It's certainly one of the finest of its genre, with German Robles in good form as Count Lavud, the Vampire. A pretty young woman travels to the eerie mansion of her ancestors, accompanied by a doctor (Abel Salazar). Something is not quite right when she learns that one of her aunts has just mysteriously died, and another aunt seems rather strange and exceptionally young. It turns out that the blood-sucking Lavud is behind it all, and Salazar has to take on the role of hero. I was very impressed with the consistency in set design, production values, and all-around creepiness and foggy atmosphere that helps make this winner a classic of its kind. Abel Salazar produced this himself, reportedly very keen on following in the step of the old Universals, and it pays off handsomely. *** out of ****"

However, when I first wrote this review I had only seen the K. Gordon Murray dubbed version. I expressed thoughts that the Spanish version might be better.

Not as much care and attention has gone into this one; the film lacks the excellent atmospheric night-time shots of the original and the plot is not as well defined, but in spite of these things; The Vampire's Coffin is certainly an enjoyable romp that fans of the original should at least appreciate. The film starts off rather well with a sequence that sees a bunch of grave robbers accidentally resurrect the evil Count Karol de Lavud (an influence on Dracula 2000?) by removing the stake from his heart. The Count soon decides to turn his liberators into zombies, and proceeds to resume his mission from the first film. Naturally, it all falls down to the heroic Dr. Enrique Saldívar (Abel Salazar, returning to his role from the first film) to rescue the girl, kill the count and save the day."

Good supporting actors like Richard Jaekel, Luke Askew and Robert DoQui end up with very little to do. I would give the film one-star strictly on its good intentions, but the screenplay is a transparent and lazy mass of routine predicaments and the production is cheapjack.

This film is actually scary! Am I saying that you're going to jump out of your seat when you watch ""Nurse Sherri""? No, of course not. But this pastiche of elements from ""The Exorcist"", ""Ruby"", and ""Carrie"" is one of those nice, eerie little horror movies common to the '70s. You can't put your finger on what's so spooky about it, but the film drips with atmosphere. (And what an ending! Don't worry, I won't spoil it for you.) Adamson and producer Sam Sherman really nailed it with this one, and it doesn't matter whether ""Nurse Sherri"" was a calculated success or a happy accident. Jill Jacobson is likable but not outstanding as the hapless nurse who becomes possessed by the spirit of a recently deceased cult leader (Bill Roy, who shines in his brief role). Geoffrey Land is okay as her surly doctor boyfriend. There are some blaxploitative elements here (profit was the bottom line with these cheap drive-in flicks, after all) but they actually contribute to the plot rather than just being window dressing. ""Nurse Sherri"" was a Poverty Row production, and it shows at times (sets, special effects, etc.). Still, the film has heart, mostly decent acting and direction, and some genuine chills. Sam Sherman also saw fit to use Harry Lubin's theme music for the late '50s/early '60s television series ""One Step Beyond"" in this film, which certainly adds to the creepy atmosphere. The DVD contains two significantly different cuts of the movie (the early version features a lot of T&A that wound up on the cutting room floor to make way for more horrific stuff) as well as the theatrical trailer, the TV spot, and a great commentary by Sherman. Does anybody know whatever happened to Bill Roy, by the way? Next to John Carradine, he's the best actor I've ever seen in an Al Adamson film, and he plays the cult leader like he means it."

No big deal, he'll just turn into a glowing green blob and possess Nurse Sherri (Jill Jacobson) to get revenge on the doctors who he feels killed him. This is bad news for Sherri's love life as her boyfriend Peter (Geoffrey Land) was one of the docs. Peter notices the changes in Sherri and it seems only a blinded former NFL player with knowledge of voodoo (!) who is a patient can offer the way for two nurses (Marilyn Joi and Mary Kay Pass) to help release Sheri from this transcendental terror. If you are familiar with Adamson's work, you'll know what to expect here as this has lots of static shots that go on too long and flat acting. There is also one of the funniest and most random car chases when a drunken follower confronts Peter – who is oddly not intrigued by this man's story, despite knowing his girl is now possessed – in a parking garage. They then burst out onto the city streets and end up in the desert within minutes. The poor follower survives having the roof of his car ripped off and leaps out just before it drives off a cliff and explodes (the film's highlight). The Shock-o-rama DVD offers an alternate version of the film title simply NURSE SHERRI and it is actually really interesting.

There is no question at all that it is poorly acted, poorly directed, has poor sets and scenery and terrible special effects.

That's OK though, because I got a kick out of this tale featuring Bela Lugosi in a dual role - college psychology Professor Brenner by day, and neighborhood soup kitchen proprietor Karl Wagner by night. Lugosi's character uses the mission as a hunting ground for criminals on the run from the law, who he lures into his web to commit jewel robberies. Only trouble is, his escapades leave the body of a dead accomplice at each heist. With good help hard to find, this will surely come back to haunt him."

I agree with most reviewers that this should not be compared to any Hollywood blockbusters (my title was being facetious). Albeit not overly original, this fun action/crime film was really well put together. The writing was tight and the directing on point. I've seen seasoned writers and directors come up with some flop films lately, so it's refreshing for a new filmmaker to come up with an almost flawless production. The 92 min runtime was just right, and the pacing was perfect. Cinematography was good, and the score surprisingly fitting for a B-grade international production. Casting was well put together with all performances convincing, especially the French Jason Statham looking, Alban Lenoir as Lino.

No sooner has Lino proved himself a worthy addition to the team than corrupt cops blast him, and Lino flees the scene of the shooting. An overconfident detective, Areski (Nicolas Duvauchelle) shoots Charas when he comes to arrest the mechanics working with the dirty cops. Areski has Lino arrested, but our hero manages to escape custody during a riveting brawl at police headquarters.

It's just beating and stabbing and shooting until the protagonist (who's an invincible boogeyman) died. He had a very traumatic reason for being a vigilante but he was portrayed as a very erratic and unsure character. The woman became so readily involved in this bloody revenge and that didn't make any sense.

The real rapist sent a few masked hitmen to the house and our immortal duo killed them one by one. The two guys succumbed to their wounds at the end and the woman gave candies to the kids because it was Halloween.

The bank robbery set piece is a lot of fun (Faust turns visible again in the middle of the gig!) and the thrilling conclusion ends with a literal explosive bang. Both Meredith M. Nicholson's sharp black and white cinematography and Darrell Calker's moody score give this picture a cool film noir-style atmosphere.

It comes in a few different versions, some bloodier and sexier than others. It actually works in either the softer or hotter versions. The grue-- including a nude woman threatened with scissors, a head crushed in a door, a gory fall of a ledge, a woman slashed with a jagged piece of glass, and a nail driven into an eye-- is lively, but the central story about the traumatized heroine being cared for by her malevolent uncle and his murderous son is strong enough to stand on its own. There are also the expected scenes of black mass and nude female worshipers. The film plays nicely on our expectations and manages to surprise. With all the garish colors and hazy turn of events, we're never quite certain if everyone is off their rocker, the heroine especially possibly going off on some flight of fantasy triggered by the accident and exacerbated by the legend of the ancestress witch. Plus, characters you expect to play a pivotal role die suddenly, it's hard to tell who is trustworthy and who isn't, and Martin Potter as the cousin vacillates so perfectly between being a morose companion to the girl and a frenzied monster to everyone else that I found myself just as lulled in by him. The violent scenes are shocking and unpredictable, while the talkier sequences have a weirdly cold atmosphere to them. For me, this one gets unfairly written off far too often."

Candace Glendenning, a brunette beauty with a striking pair of blue eyes, is featured as Catherine, a young woman about to turn 20 who travels with mum & dad to visit the long unseen Uncle Alexander (a solid Michael Gough, rocking an impressively big and bushy moustache here), who lives in a country estate with his unhinged son Stephen (Martin Potter) and his luscious secretary Frances (Barbara Kellerman).

On her way out, Stephen smashes her head in the door and then stabs her death in charming close-up. Meanwhile, pretty London teen Catherine Yorke (Candace Glendenning), who is plagued by some odd premonitions, heads out on a week long vacation with her parents to visit some distant relatives she's never met before. Unfortunately, as soon as the car pulls into the secluded Yorke family country estate, the car crashes into a tree in the front yard. When Catherine gets out to get help, the car blows up and kills both dad and mum. Though she's only slightly distraught by the bizarre accident, uncle Alexander Yorke (Michael Gough), who immediately announces he's not only her uncle but also a doctor, decides it would be best if Cathy stayed for a few days to re-coop and get to know him and his son, her cousin Stephen (the nut from the opening sequence). Also in the house is a bitter ""secretary"" named Francis (Barbara Kellerman), who is also Stephen's part-time lover."

Well sure, it's not a patch on his earlier work but still it remains a remotely enjoyable bloodbath with some inventive killings (the snails!!) and an appealing cast of young & sexy schoolgirls. The story, although highly unoriginal, is easy to follow, unpretentious and fast-paced. Black sheep of Catholic girl's dorm Kathy is involved in a near-fatal car accident after a prank with the school's gym teacher. Shortly after, a new and extrovert girl makes her entry in the dorm but her mind seems controlled by the comatose Kathy. Through Eva Gordon, Kathy and her spiritual mother see a chance for revenge, starting with the death of the insufferable macho gym teacher. Fulci keeps the gore under control this time and focuses more on the brooding atmosphere. ""Aenigma"" features some beautiful camera-work, although admittedly, the same camera angles are often re-used several times. The girls' acting is extremely hammy and it's a good thing they all all look so cute, otherwise it would have been a lot more difficult to struggle yourself through the movie.

But wait, let's remember that Fulci is still visually inventive in 87, with lots of great camera moves and flair. The man knew how to tell a story, folks. He may have been a jerk to his colleagues, but what a great craftsman. He was trying to make a US style teenager quasi slasher popcorn movie here, a lighter less horrifying type of deal. I think it should also be said that this was well cast. The beautiful college girls each play their roles with unique personalities, something you won't find in most US films of this type. The geeky girl in the red dress is a hoot, and so is the famous snail scene. Best of all is the English new wave/pop sappy romance song that sets up the audience perfectly. It's an interesting and engaging story, even if it is clearly inspired by Carrie. And unlike so many other horror films, the ending is rewarding, logical AND suspenseful.

3248,tt0074213,/review/rw0146017/?ref_=tt_urv,"Jim Kelly was a great fighter, but no Richard Roundtree or Fred Williamson as an actor. He was good as the third banana (after Bruce Lee and John Saxon) in the martial arts classic 'Enter The Dragon', and even better in the surprisingly entertaining starring vehicle 'Black Belt Jones'. But that movies ""sequel"" 'Hot Potato' was pretty awful and the prospect of Kelly being teamed up with legendary schlockmeister Al Adamson ('Horror Of The Blood Monsters', 'Dracula vs. Frankenstein', 'Naughty Stewardesses',etc.etc.), made me think I was in for one of THE worst movies ever made. But you know what? This movie was ineptly dubbed, badly acted, had some crappy dialogue and was full of dull stock footage, but I still actually enjoyed it. Not much, but at least SOME, which is something I certainly didn't expect! Kelly plays an agent of D.R.A.G.O.N. which sounds really cool, but we're never told what that means exactly. The movie opens with him on holiday, but some guys in suits spoil it by making him a proposal to eliminate Janikan (Bill Roy), the leader of a drug/voodoo/slave trade cult. He refuses initially but is then told that his own girlfriend Tokai (Essie Lin Chia), who I think is an ambassador's daughter or something, has been kidnapped by these evil mofos. So of course, Kelly goes instantly into action, opening several cans of whup-ass on assorted thugs, voodoo baddies, midgets and even a vulture (named Vultron!). Adamson being Adamson, he still manages to make all this nowhere near as entertaining and exciting as you'd imagine, but there are still a few decent fight sequences, and a memorable jet-pack ride by Kelly. The supporting cast is very odd, and cult fans will get a big kick out of it because it includes D'Urville Martin (Reverend Rufus in Larry Cohen's 'Black Caesar' and 'Hell Up In Harlem' and director of the blaxploitation cult fave 'Dolemite'), Biff Yeager (from 'Repo Man' and other Alex Cox movies), little person Felix Silla (Cousin Itt from 'The Addams Family', 'Demon Seed', 'The Brood'), and even tough guy Aldo Ray ('We're No Angels', 'Angel Unchained'). 'Black Samurai' is trash, but there's lots of dumb fun to be had, especially if you keep the pizza and cold beers flowing throughout. And as bad as it is, it's STILL better than 'Hot Potato'!"

He plays Robert Sand (Bobby to his mates) who is on holiday playing tennis with some hotties with the phone off the hook whenever his employers come to him for help in breaking a right of black-magic using international drug dealers. Sands of course says no, until he finds the group have kidnapped the daughter of the Japanese Ambassador to the US (Toki) who also happens to be Sand's girlfriend (albeit not one he is particularly faithful to).

Leon S. Kennedy is again the protagonist of this movie, I would choose a different guy this time but they managed to portrait him well in this animated movie, but not as good as in RE: Degeneration. The side-characters were not well enough developed and they lacked a bit in background story and ambitions. I really liked the president of this ""Eastern Slav Republic"", she was hot, she was well development and simply an intriguing character. Compared to RE: Degeneration this movie felt a bit weaker because I think the dramaturgy didn't go that well and too many things were left unclear which is really sad - maybe some of the games give an explanation, but that certainly doesn't make this movie better. A really interesting thing is how this story actually kinda foresaw the Ukraine/Krim-Crisis in a very abstracted way, because this movie was released a short while before stuff started to go wild over there... even the president kinda reminds heavily of the general-secretary of the Krim Republic (and internet-star) Natalja Poklonskaja which is an (almost?) prophetic coincidence.

You may recognize this movie because it was shoe-horned into the much worse ""Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders,"" which was featured once on Mystery Science Theater 3000. It was nice to see it as a standalone movie, which I didn't even realized existed. Granted, this movie could have been edited down to half its length and been better, but that can be said about most cheesy horror movies. I don't think it's quite as bad as a lot of people say.

Girl of single-parenting father brings monkey-doll as a present for his son birthday. It turns out that in a monkey resides a murderous demon which is impossible to get rid of. When I saw the IMDb rating of 2.4, I was thinking whether to give it a chance at all, but I was dead set to see all the films inspired by Stephen King and not to skip anything. The first half hour is a real agony. The film shows an idyllic life in the suburbs and everything is bright and cheerful and the atmosphere is like in some Disney comedy for little children. In addition, the film is so cheap that it is difficult to classify it as B production. Rather somewhere in the range from X to Z. Literally nothing happens, not even introduction to characters so we can empathize with them later. So virtually redundant unprovoked half an hour. I was at the very edge of giving up on it when the movie finally caught my attention, until finally, I was sitting at the edge of my chair, and even stood up to go and turn the lights on. The story is great, and the film manages to be very creepy and even scary, despite the fact it is happening during the day and despite the complete absence of almost all elements typical of horror. There is no darkness, no surprises, no monsters, no gore. Even despite the terrible production. The end is quite predictable, but the fact that I knew what was going to happen did not spoil my experience at all. I was rather eager to see if I was right, and when the prediction came true, I rejoiced as a child. People resent the lack of nudity, violence, and gore typical of the B horrors of the '80s, but these objections are unfounded, since those elements do not fit into this story. Basically, the only really significant drawbacks are idling in the first half of the movie and poor production. With a decent budget, it might have been a great episode of some horror series, like ""Twilight Zone"" or ""Tales from the Darkside"". With better production and run-time between 30 and 45 minutes, this would be a strong eight, maybe more, but this way I rate it five out of ten, more for effort than objective quality."

It's NOTHING like that. It's actually closer to some of Hitchcock's ""average guy""-caught-in-a-web-of-intrigue pictures like 'The 39 Steps' or 'North By Northwest'. Anyway, however you label it it's a really entertaining romantic adventure movie that most people should enjoy. Two things really help it - the locales and the cast. Jean-Paul Belmondo ('Breathless') is one of the coolest and most charismatic leading men to ever stand in front of a movie camera, and he really makes this movie worth watching. It also doesn't hurt that the supporting cast includes the beautiful Francoise Dorleac (Polanski's 'Cul-de-sac') and 'Rififi's Jean Servais. I can't argue that this is anything but pure entertainment, but for what it is it is difficult to beat, and if you just want to have some fun then 'That Man From Rio' is highly recommended."
3276,tt0058203,/review/rw1962578/?ref_=tt_urv,"Some of my fondest of memories as a child was sitting in the library and immersing myself into the Ligne Claire reality of George Remi's ""The Adventures Of Tintin"". They had such a timeless quality and vision about them, just like the period in which they were set. The colors were so vibrant and illustrations were clearly defined. Herge's Illustrations themselves defined a new standard of a comic 'universal language' that spoke more words than any bubble text that was added on. You knew who the bad guys, the good guys and the stereotypes were. You knew when characters were nervous, angry, happy, confident, stupid, clumsy and surprised. You even knew when they were sweating! The attention to emotion and narration was brilliant. While reading his albums (24 in total) I felt like I was in a movie. The characters were all strange, mysterious, suspicious and one dimensional except for the protagonist (Tintin) and the world was as simple as black and white/good and evil. The stories were always bizarre but world weary and highly adventurous at the same time. I couldn't stop reading them. Not once was I aware I was reading a comic book. The pace builds momentum and doesn't stop. Herge's greatest gift was his ability to effortlessly make a transition in mood and tone. His illustrations evoke shades of Film-Noir when they're serious, 'Charlie Chaplin' absurdity when they're comical and a 'Sherlock Holmes/Arsene Lupin' mystery inspired approach in their narrative. It is the combination of these three key genres that made Tintin and all the films, books and comics it inspired so special. One of the earliest of these was perhaps the greatest of these, ""L'Homme de Rio"" (""That Man From Rio""), a Jean Paul Belmondo vehicle hugely influenced by Herge's ""The Broken Ear"" with subtle footnotes to ""The Calculus Affair"", ""The Seven Crystal Balls"" and ""The Secret Of The Unicorn""."

Not that the plot is anything more than a convenient excuse for a series of exhilarating set-pieces with M.Belmondo sailing blithely through them all whilst searching Brazil for his kidnapped girl-friend.He is an airman doing his ""Service Militaire Obligatoire"" who is forced to go AWOL in the most photogenic locations near the burgeoning new city of Brasilia.Filmed in sumptuous colour ""L'homme de Rio"" is a feast for the eye.M.Belmondo is les nads du chien as the reluctant hero,permanently perplexed as the film develops around him.It contains one of my favourite shots in any movie,a marvellous zoom to a Big Close-up of an alligator's unblinking eye and a brilliantly staged barroom brawl that has been copied many times but never bettered.It really should be seen in the cinema to appreciate its scope,but I have no idea when or if a movie revival is planned.Those of us who were fortunate enough to see it 40 years ago on the big screen and are now queueing up to collect our pensions can perhaps be excused a secret smile at the memories it evokes."

Leo Gordon's deliciously lurid and melodramatic script plays like a blithely low-rent redneck version of ""Peyton Place"" with ghastly beasts tossed into the mix to spice things up. The colorful hillbilly characters are a real hoot (Gene Roth is especially amusing as a huffy bonehead sheriff). Ken Clark contributes an engaging performance as the stalwart ranger hero. Jan Shepard is equally appealing as Clark's sweet girlfriend. The delectable Yvette Vickers brings an irresistibly naughty ""Babydoll""ish allure to her juicy role of a brazen hick hussy. 50's B-picture regular Bruno VeSota truly shines as Vickers' angry and obese cuckolded general store manager husband. The monsters are really hokey, but that only adds to the film's considerable schlocky charm. The scenes in an underwater cave with the hideous leeches sucking blood from their luckless shrieking victims are genuinely gross, chilling and even downright disturbing. John A. Nicholaus' stark, gritty cinematography and Alexander Laszlo's shuddery ooga-booga bombastic score are likewise on the money.

The movie has dreadful performances, dreadful scenery, dreadful special effects, and dreadful lighting. I really cannot find much good to say about it other than as bad films go you could do a lot worse as far as finding something dreadful to sit through. It is bearably short and has many moments of unintended humor. Missed cues, lighting faux pas, off-screen terror, an unbelievably inane score, and of course John Agar trying his level best to be the core of the film with an earnest performance amidst this muck.

This is the kind of grisly body horror clearly indebted to Carpenter's THE THING, but delivering fresh twists on the premise. For once, everything comes together in a low budget film: the performances are great, better than many a Hollywood producer where millions have been blown on big-name stars; the script is intelligent and witty, and the direction spot on. There's a pleasing reliance on traditional prosthetic effects rather than rubbishy CGI work.

Sure maybe I was setting myself up for some awkward moments by brining my girlfriend to watch it at the Calgary Underground Film Festival but i cant say i wasn't warned. Any synopsis on this film will tell you that its about three guys who are trying to kill a man who raped and murdered their fathers. I was hoping that maybe they would go light on the father raping and get right into the revenge plot but the truth is they didn't go light on anything but modesty and morality. For anyone wondering if they should watch this movie or not just know that it is extremely offencive, gory, wrong, and funny all at the same time and is absolutely never boring. Thats what i loved most about this movie is that it is never dull, not for a second. Sure there is one scene out of all the nasty shat going on that truly made me uncomfortable (it involved our introduction to the Tweek character), but it happened early on in the film and they definitely made up for it with the copious amounts of comedy in the second half. The dialogue and chemistry between the actors is spot on and hilarious and i both laughed out loud and cringed and groaned more than a couple times. The gore is hilarious, the characters are hilarious, the plot is hilarious, hell even everything i've heard from these guys on facebook and other blogs since watching this movie has been hilarious. Since watching this at CUFF i've become quite intrigued by this group. They are incredibly inspiring having made a film that looks 5 times more expensive than what they made it for. I've also picked up their ""wtf is astron-6"" DVD compilation which isn't quite as amazing as this movie but is just as inspiring. Now i honestly cant wait for ""Manborg"" which I'm guessing will be released approximately 2 months after whatever release date they first present us with but after watching Fathers Day I'm basically guaranteed it will be well worth the wait. If i won the lottery i would donate it to astron-6."

Well, because it seemed like a fun horror comedy that paid heavy homage to the horror movies of the 1980s, the movies that I grew up watching."
3321,tt11252440,/review/rw7192316/?ref_=tt_urv,"'Psycho Goreman (2020)' is like 'Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (1993 - 1996)' meets 'Evil Dead II (1987)' by way of 'Flash Gordon (1980)', a schlocky Saturday morning show crossed with a gooey splat-stick comedy and a campy sci-fi throwback. It's the kind of thing that knows exactly what it is and doesn't care if you like it or not. Frankly, its irreverence is charming. Though it isn't hilarious, it provokes a genuine chuckle perhaps more often than expected and is generally just about subversive enough to properly work, despite its somewhat generic arcs and obviously low budget. Though some may be put off by its low-fi bizarreness, it ought to hit the spot for those who it is aimed at and that's all it really cares about. It isn't going to win any awards or break any box-office records, but it isn't trying to. It feels very much like a passion project that was just as fun to make as it is to watch. Its budget is put to good use on some generally impressive special effects, which only very occasionally take you out of the piece's purposefully 'cheesy' aesthetic. Even when they do, the visual concepts are unique enough that you can easily forgive any money-related shortcomings. It's an entertaining time pretty much from start to finish. If you meet it on its own terms, you should have a good bit of fun with it. 7/10."

The recent DVD release reveals far better original material than the old VHS showed. We get to see every droplet in the swirling fog, every quiver of the dancers' flesh. We get to see just how dead Criswell's pan is. Every flaw is brilliantly illuminated. How can this old low-budget stuff end up looking better than many a modern film?"

With him is his girlfriend ""Shirley"" (Pat Barrington) who would prefer to be just about anywhere else. Anyway, as they are driving Bob takes a turn much too fast and they are both thrown out of the vehicle just as night begins to fall. It's at this time that they both hear strange music playing near the cemetery and go to check it out. What they find is both odd and deeply disturbing. Now, as far as this movie is concerned I found it to be extremely long and tedious with the only scenes even remotely of interest being the dance routines of several ""ghouls"" (for want of a better word) forced to perform a striptease for an underworld demon of some sort called ""the Emperor"" (Criswell). It's all rather weird and nonsensical with the awkward dialogue and horrid acting being the low points of an otherwise boring movie. In short, this is a bad movie and viewers should hesitate before wasting 92 minutes of their life they will never get back."

Come on, a movie with three rappers (Tyrese throws down the rhymes also, yo!)? There's no way I would've expected that to satisfy my entertainment needs. But I'm man enough to admit that I would've been wrong."
3329,tt0430105,/review/rw1149450/?ref_=tt_urv,"One good thing Steven Spielberg has done for 21th century movies is to show the importance of starting things off with a bang rather than a whimper, something he learned from the old grade B films of the 30's, 40's, and 50's. So when director John Singleton begins ""Four Brothers"" he doesn't dwell on background material about how mom came to be the shining star for her boys. Singleton goes right for the jugular by showing mom's demise--I say showing, the viewer doesn't actually see the killing in the beginning. Singleton builds up the relationship between mom and the brothers step by step, letting a Detroit policeman, Lt. Green (Terrence Howard), introduce the four brothers as they show up for the funeral and become reacquainted. Not to give away the story, one heavy leads to another until the whole city of Detroit becomes a personification of corruption and evil. I loved the Motown music played throughout the film which was very apropos for the setting."

The story moves along and does not step outside of itself. There are some intriguing plot twists, but the goal of revenge always remains. The performances are solid; we have experienced film actors and a director here who know what they're doing. Even the newer actors settle into their respective roles..."

Pretty soon Susan just ain't acting like herself anymore; she starts seducing and murdering various guys. It's up to concerned psychiatrist Dr. Simon Andrews (nicely played by Norman Burton) to save Susan's soul before it's too late. Director Michael Dugan does a sound job of creating and maintaining a flesh-crawling ooga-booga atmosphere, pours on a handy helping of juicy gore (the definite splatter highlight occurs when Susan levitates a guy and sends the man falling to his death from a three story balcony onto a glass table), tosses in several moments of hilariously campy humor, and has the luscious Ms. Bresee bare her insanely hot body at pleasingly regular intervals. The game cast do their best with the rather silly material: the ever-cool Marjoe Gortner as Susan's loving, but busy husband Oliver, Laura Hippe as Susan's worried Aunt Cora Nomed, and Sheri Mann as helpful demonic possession expert Dr. Roni Logan. LaWanda Page (Aunt Esther on ""Sanford and Son"") provides gut-busting lowbrow comic relief as superstitious black maid Elsie. Maurice Sherbanee likewise amuses as creepy, lecherous Mexican gardener Ben. Robert Barich's polished cinematography makes occasional inspired use of a fluid gliding Steadicam. Jaime Mendoza-Nava's spooky'n'moody score does the shuddery trick. John Carl Buechler comes through with a marvelously grotesque make-up design for the hideously ugly female demon; the foul beast's drooling, fanged, snarling breasts are particularly funky and memorable.

Now I know many people have a disdain for Michael Bay, but I actually think that he brings some visual prowess to his projects however it's clear that his name was only attached for recognition purposes. This is neither anything visually bombastic or anything close to being a pulse pounding thriller. It's a very amateur romantic drama that focuses more on the interpersonal communication between characters as they struggle through the changing times. It becomes increasingly dragging and you just keep asking yourself what the real intent of the overall film really is. Some of the actors are seasoned veterans but are truly underutilized for new or younger actors that are frankly not on par. The production value is that of a cancelled TV series on the big networks as well. Overall this is just a very big failure and definitely not what I was expecting."

It god critically shredded by the few people who did see it, and quickly forgotten. I think this may be because of odd marketing,and the cultural rifts in different areas of both the world, and cinema. It was marketed in North America as a supernatural shocker starring Val Kilmer, which was a cheap shot to fans and in fact false advertising. Kilmer is in it, for maybe ten minutes, and is very good, but the story isn't his. It's also supernatural, but in a far more subtle, ambiguous and inaccessible way that the ADHD-ridden audiences over here just aren't used to. In short, it's very European, and they just seem to have a better handle on the intuition it takes to make an atmospheric chiller than anyone else, also seeming to be more connected with ghost lore and the spirit realm. The story concerns a priest named Father Owen (hollywood's resident alien Vincent Gallo, playing it dead straight here). He has traveled to Moscow I hopes of finding his friend Professor Sergey (Rade Serbedzija), who has descended into ancient catacombs and endless tunnels below the surface of the city in hopes of finding a lost artifact hidden during wartime. He joins up with a group of guides and Moscow natives including the beautiful Lubya (Oksana Akinshina) and a tracker named Yuri (Joaquim De Almeida) to traverse the underside of the city and find his friend. There are long, eerie scenes of Sergey wandering around the dimly lit labyrinth, pursuing his scholarly goal and talking to himself as strange shadows and far away whispers follow him around, gradually letting the viewer know that he's not alone. Owen and his team rendezvous with Tolstoy (Joss Ackland) the elderly leader of a tribe of tunnel dwellers who won't go below a certain level of the catacombs, who provides a map. Then they go deeper. Kilmer plays Andrey, a Russian dude who runs a gang that are in control of opening and closing a deep fissure gate that is said to lead to a hell like place. He's relaxed, in both demeanor and the Russian accent, but he's clearly having fun in one of his more character type roles. The catacombs have a haunted feel to them, and indeed there are ghosts, but not presented in the way you might think. The way the human characters see them is quite different from how they see themselves, and how the audience sees them, which is a nice touch. The story keeps itself mysterious, right up until it's puzzling, creepy conclusion, buy I prefer that open ended, almost experimental style over desperate attempts to scare us. It's atmospheric, strange, unique, thick with ideas and altogether a bit of brilliance. Definitely an acquire taste, though."

The plot is very straight to follow since it's just about a quest to find SERGEI (played by Rade Serbedzija) an old friend of the father OWEN (played by Vincent Gallo) that went to the catacombs of Moscow alone. The entire movie is passed in there. Though the film has a very open ending, which is, by the way, very well connected to the mysterious and mystical ambiance that is always present What I appreciated the most in the film was precisely this mystical and supernatural ambiance of this story and the way it was shot. It has a great cinematography, creating very dark and claustrophobic scenarios. The soundtrack is also good, because it also has mysterious, dark, melancholic and melodic music, like a ghost story must have! One other detail that I also appreciated was the fact of the demons were characterized only as shadows, as a dark light in the underworld I found it so much better than the traditional way of characterize demons as little monsters with sharpened teethes, horns and a back tail "

The problem I have with this story is that a ""good witch"" is eventually called upon to defeat an evil entity, but in reality that is always only a ruse since a house divided against itself cannot stand. ""Good witchcraft"" and ""bad witchcraft"" are only two sides of the same coin, and can only be trounced by a person walking in the Light of Jesus the Anointed. So the girl is saved from the unclean spirit of the burned woman, but her finance loses a finger--and what happens to her when the story is over?

Oddly enough, I think this may have been the start of late 70's scifi shows with alien beings in polyester jumpsuits, cheesy special effects and laser beams, and giant monitor screens for communications. In addition to the SMDM, the Bionic Woman series as well as Wonder Woman, Battlestar Galactica, and Buck Rogers were all notorious for doing this in the late 70's but you what? I love it anyway!! The Return of Bigfoot was also a great 2 part Bionic Crossover with both Steve and Jamie and Bigfoot was played by Ted Cassidy.

3409,tt0091264,/review/rw1872894/?ref_=tt_urv,"Some of the reviews I encountered on ""In the Shadow of Kilimanjaro"" complain that baboons aren't convincing and not nearly menacing enough to pass for murderous animals. Well, this is a false impression in general. During a recent trip to South Africa I made a couple of excursions and the first thing the tour guides always warn you for are wild baboons. They are extremely aggressive animals and if they spot people with food in their hands, they will relentlessly attack and steal it from them. I'm not familiar with the supposedly true event this movie is based on, but I find it to be quite plausible and – even in case it never happened – it's a terrific plot outline for a mature and intellectual eco-horror movie anyway. The year is 1984 and Kenya, as well as the majority of the African continent, slowly cringes under a severe drought. It hasn't rained in months, the wildlife deteriorates, the animals are dying and a local community of mine workers do whatever they can to survive. They suddenly face an even more overpowering ordeal when all the baboons in the area, approximately 90.000, herd together and launch spontaneous attacks against the humans in their quest for food. ""In the Shadow of Kilimanjaro"" is a fairly odd and unusual 80's horror movie, since it doesn't aim for mindless shocks or bloody set-pieces, but merely thrives on atmosphere and educational values. The first half hour is really slow and moody, but this is mostly done to illustrate the atmosphere of drought and despair they characters find themselves trapped in. Once the baboons go on their virulent murder sprees, the film becomes more adventurous and horrific (with images of ripped off limbs and half-eaten faces) but still the violence never becomes gratuitous or overly exploitative. The make-up effects are effective and big kudos to the animal trainers, because a lot of footage was filmed using real animals. The mechanical baboons, used during the more complicated attack scenes, are definitely convincing as well. This mainly African-produced film features two international stars delivering more than adequate performances, namely Timothy Bottoms as a park supervisor (and kind of looking like a big ape himself, what with the ferocious beard) and John Rhys-Davies as the demanding mine owner. ""In the Shadow of Kilimanjaro"" is a good and original film, naturally benefiting the most of the wonderful scenery and exterior filming locations, but also boosting a unique storyline and multiple moments of great suspense."

The story revolves around a girl who returns home after years to meet her family. She meets her half siblings and their friends, who are drinking in the barn. Suddenly they realize that there is something really strange roaming around the bran and their house. From there the hide and seek for their life starts. The story is acceptable but it's the presentation that bothered me. Low budget is understandable but bad lighting is not. It was sometimes really hard to even understand what exactly is going on in most of the gruesome scenes. The only thing nice in the movie is the friction between friends and siblings. Joshua Bowman (Reason I saw this movie), Gemma Atkinson, Isabella Calthrope, Peter Gadiot and Gabriel Thomson were good in their respective parts. Drunken Tom Felton is not a good thing to look at, he was over the top and not good at faking it. Overall, Trash it, the family mystery in it is not worth wasting time."

When Vic arrives, Carolyn brings her to a rave party in the underground of Paris in a location called Catacombs, and introduces her to her friends. They tell Vic that in the 500 kilometer mace, more than seven million people was buried two hundred years ago; further, the labyrinth is haunted by a monster that wears a goat mask and chase people. In accordance with the urban legend, a boy born in an incestuous intercourse was locked in the labyrinth and fed with raw meat by the Cult of the Black Virgin to be the Antichrist, becoming an evil beast. The tired and upset Victoria decides to leave the party, but she gets lost in the mace; when her sister finds her, she is attacked and killed by the beast. Victoria runs in the dark tunnels trying to reach an exit or find Carolyn's friends while she is chased by her innermost fears."
3446,tt0449471,/review/rw1943492/?ref_=tt_urv,"Few things are as infuriating as great horror settings that are entirely wasted on trite scenarios. Catacombs  immense and ominously dark mazes where thousands of ancient dead bodies are stored  form the absolute greatest locations to set a horrific story in, but the creators of this movie ruined all the potential they were offered here. Surely this could have been an interesting film, but the unoriginal script almost immediately reverts to clichéd situations, chaotic editing and creating false suspense. The emotionally unstable Victoria travels to Paris, following an invitation from her sister Carolyn, and promptly gets dragged into the wild nightlife of illegal parties thrown in the catacombs underneath the city center. When she gets separated from the group, Victoria finds herself relentlessly pursued by a raving madman and they expect us to believe it concerns an inbred and carnivorous monster wearing a goat head mask. You'll notice right away there are several things wrong with the narrative. Why would the partying sister bother to invite such an uptight individual like Victoria to a place where drugs and hideous Techno music reign? Why would an insatiable killing machine exclusively chase isolated party-goers when there are hundreds of unsuspecting easy targets waiting to be butchered in the room next door? Once Victoria is trapped inside the underground labyrinth, ""Catacombs"" turns into an intolerably boring and irritating film. She just stumbles around the passageways for hours, praying the batteries of her flashlight won't die  which they do a couple of times, of course, and you'll find yourself staring at a black screen throughout very long periods - and suffering ridiculous injuries, like cutting her leg on the spokes of a rusty bicycle. Oh, the horror! This movie is slow and boring, the hectic editing of randomly creepy images is pointless, the soundtrack is god-awful and not a single one of the lead characters is even mildly amiable. Victoria constantly whines and, to me personally, it's a complete mystery why she's such a confused woman. She's young, attractive, supposedly intelligent and free to spontaneously leave everything behind and travel to Europe. So  what the heck is the problem? The French boys serve as dumb screen fillings and Carolyn is positively one of the most annoying horror characters ever. Pink is an even worse actress than singer, for that matter. Throughout almost its entire playtime, ""Catacombs"" was destined to receive a rating 1 out of 10 from me, but then came the ending which suddenly brought an unexpected highpoint. There are two end ""twists"", by the way. One is painfully frustrating and caused me to hate the film even more, but luckily there's a second one which turned tragedies around a bit and all of a sudden the film was good enough to increase my rating towards two."

And there's a good reason for it, obviously good enough reason to get the likes of Sean Connery, Trevor Howard, Lila Kedrova, and John Rhys-Davies to take part in this admittedly cheesy production.

Unsurprisingly this is what it was - the type of thriller that you could stop after 15 minutes and pretty much guess the rest. Of course the reason why we know this type of plot is that some films have done it really well and made it a model to be leant on, but not this film. Instead it plays it out in the most obvious way, with little effort in the writing and no twists or turns to even vaguely excite - everything is heavily signposted as if they didn't trust the viewer to get anything by themselves. As it goes where you expect, it delivers enough distracting scenes to manage to get by, but everything is heavy-handed. The title is pretty obvious in its meaning, but it doesn't do anything clever with it, but it leans all over it from the very start. The actual thriller elements are also fairly basic and hard to believe and there was so much scope to be tighter and better."

Sure there were a few plot issues and some cliches, but it was still very suspenseful and entertaining. Just sit back and enjoy the ride.

I was astonished that there were no changes to any of the previous footage, other than the Bogdanovich voice over and the disappearance of Faith Domergue (Marcia). What has been added is a set of blonde women who hold sway on Venus and worship a Pterodactyl. They have scallop shell bras and hip hugger pants with bell bottoms made of a sheer material. I do remember that Mamie Van Doren was really quite a good looking lady and these really are some attractive women. But they never really speak. They are telepathic. They are there to show that they actually caused much of what happened to the Astronauts in the previous movie. This had to be made for the drive-in crowd to neck and ignore, simply to fill space on a triple feature. It certainly wasn't worth much time and effort."

I finally found it on DVD in one of those 50 sci-fi movies for $20. The movie itself is pretty bad, but if one enjoys 'bad' sci-fi, then this one is perfect. I still can't figure out how they got their 'space-car' to float around like it did. It looked pretty real, as did a Brontosaurus, but the Pterydactyl looked very cheesy, like it was made by a bunch of 7th graders. Anyway, I watched ""Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet"", then I watched ""Voyage to the Planet of the Prehistoric Women"" back to back. There must have been a gun to my head, I know. The movies use the exact same dubbed Russian ""Planet of Storms"" footage, but each movie spliced in their own additional footage, and the results produce 2 similar, but different story lines. ""Prehistoric Planet"" has Basil Rathbone in separate footage, as well as Faith Domergue in her own footage-they are in different space stations.....making for a clumsy (but enjoyable) plot involving rescuing the men on Venus. The robot seems to have a bigger role in this movie, although it is used to some effect in the other. ""Prehistoric Women"" has Peter Bogdanovich's voice-over narration, and the spliced-in women in clam shell bathing suits (Mamie Van Doren is the leader), who communicate telepathically. I found this one to be much more interesting of the two. The Earth men and Venus women seemed destined to meet each other, they look for each other most of the movie, but alas because it is separate footage, they never do! A somewhat surprise ending makes the movie that more interesting. I do have to comment on the eerie female singing/crying throughout the movies, made it pretty haunting. Also, some of the noises coming from the console of the space-ships sounds exactly like those heard on the original Star Trek TV show. Well, I probably spent more time talking about this movie than the production crew who actually shot the movie!"

There's enough humor and panache to keep it interesting and reviewers who've criticised it's production design and performers are somewhat out of line, when you consider the budget and amazingly short shooting schedule.  The sets and performances actually tend to work, when you compare them to the insidious TV shows being lampooned.  Frankly, the actors here do just as well as Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Freddie Prinze, Jr., Jennifer Love-Hewitt and the rest of their ilk ever do in big-budget counterparts.

The characters all run around in a maze trying to avoid being sliced and diced by a bunch of masked killers. The winner of the contest gets millions of dollars. The film takes the whole disgusting ""Fear Factor"" thing to its logical conclusion, making some good points about the blurring line between entertainment and reality, and the danger of introducing cruelty into the mix. Deveraux obviously wanted to use Freddy, Jason and Leatherface here, as he has villains that resemble them. What he does with his limited budget is really clever and he sets himself apart from the hacks with this one. I can't wait till he has some real money to work with."

Some of the dialogue was so clever, for example lines like ""those dollar bills that you worship do not bare the face of the lord"" really reflect the true intellect of the writer.

He plays a songwriter who gets into a fight with a local band when he accuses them of stealing his latest masterpiece, and then meets an attractive girl Judy (Vanessa Shaw) on a train who tells him her entire life-story - which is coincidentally the back-story to 'Horror Hospital'. His opening line to this rather sweet young lass? ""Relax, I'm not gonna rape you."" Dennis Price also shows up as a camp travel agent called Pollock, head of 'Hairy Holidays'.

But the execution undermines this, so in the end Bloodbath at the House of Death is a failure. It is not without redeeming merits though, the film is not badly made, Vincent Price while underused looks and sounds as though he is thoroughly enjoying himself and the Can Opener and toilet scenes are very effective. However, I just didn't find Bloodbath at the House of Death all that funny or horrifying. I do love comedy and I don't mind it when it is stupid and rude, but I've never liked it all that much when it's distasteful. And Bloodbath at the House of Death showed great distaste, the toilet humour is utterly infantile and the innuendos are incredibly smutty making the worst Carry On movie(the later entries had a lot of smut) seem tame. The dialogue is similarly unfunny, crude and somewhat stilted too, I even questioned whether Bary Cryer actually had anything to do with the writing at all. The story is very thin structurally and doesn't make any sense at all. I got the parodies but with two exceptions they seemed randomly strung together(and that is pretty much what the story was) and were too predictable and badly written to have any kind of impact. The ET parody was also rendered cheaply. The direction was leaden, and the entire cast were wasted. Only Price was good and even he deserved much better. Kenny Everett was very talented and evidently does try very hard but the quality of the humour here disallowed him to do anything interesting or fun with what he has. The rest of the cast don't make any kind of impression. All in all, a embarrassing failure for all involved. 3/10 Bethany Cox"

3501,tt0098622,/review/rw2141329/?ref_=tt_urv,"An evil and powerful warlock (superbly played to the deliciously wicked hilt by Julian Sands) manages to escape from the 17th century into Los Angeles in the 20th century. He's pursued by determined witch hunter Giles Redferne (a fine and intense performance by Richard E. Grant). It's up to Redferne and brash waitress Kassandra (an appealingly spunky portrayal by Lori Singer) to stop the warlock before he gathers up all the pages of the witches' bible the Grand Grimoire, learns God's true name, and undoes all creation. Director Steve Miner, working from a witty, compelling, and imaginative script by David Twothy, relates the involving story at a constant snappy pace, spices up the horrific action with a neat line in pitch-black macabre humor, and stages the exciting climax in an old cemetery with real rip-snorting gusto. While Miner basically downplays the graphic gore, he still tosses in a few pleasingly nasty touches: the warlock cuts a man's finger off, bites the same guy's tongue out, and spits it in a frying pan and acquires the ability to fly by cooking the fat of an unbaptized boy. Moreover, the casting of the smoothly handsome Sands as one very fearsome villain and the scruffy Grant as a decidedly rough around the edges protagonist is quite fresh and inspired. The film further benefits from bang-up acting from a tip-top cast: Sands, Grant, and Singer are all excellent in the leads, Richard Kuss does well as a devout Mennonite, and Mary Woronov has an amusing cameo as a phony spiritualist. David Eggby's slick cinematography gives the film an impressively glossy look. Jerry Goldsmith's typically robust and moody score likewise hits the stirring spot. The special effects are a bit dodgy, but overall acceptable. A highly entertaining fright feature."
3502,tt0098622,/review/rw0276813/?ref_=tt_urv,"It usually takes a special audience to love most of the movies I review. But there's something truly wrong with you if you can't sit back and enjoy Warlock.  It's nothing but pure fun.  Warlock is a Steve Miner classic. Like his previous film, House, it's loaded with inventiveness.  David Twohy's (Pitch Black, Critters 2) script is marvelous and gives us many memorable moments.  My favorite occurs when Lori Singer is hammering the Warlock's tracks in the train yard; extremely original.  Another great sequence is when the Grand Grimoire is finally assembled.  The acting is stellar for the genre.  You have gotta love Richard E. Grant's (Bram Stoker's Dracula) accent:  ""Witches loathe salt.""  Julian Sands is always superb but is at his most evil in this role.  He truly is the Warlock (which is why I'll never watch the third Warlock installment).  Steve Miner has brought us some good genre flicks and this is, without a doubt, one of his best (forget about H20)."

3506,tt0085627,/review/rw1805641/?ref_=tt_urv,"I bet the almighty Lucio Fulci didn't half realize back in 1984 how progressive and visionary the concept of his film would become. Sure the idea of recruiting death row prisoners as futuristic gladiators and broadcast their battle to live and death live on television is still extremely grotesque but the underlying and less obvious themes of ""The New Gladiators""  like the appalling formula of reality-TV and the always-increasing quest for sensationalism  were way ahead of their time. This film is one of the numerous futuristic exploitation ventures that were released in the early 80's, all of them with the intention of cashing in on the huge success of John Carpenter's ""Escape from New York"". All these movies are incredibly violent, feature grim sets and flamboyant effect and  oh yeah  for some reason they practically all star Fred Williamson! I think Fred actually lived in between the decors and on the sets of low-budget Italian flicks back then. Anyway, Fulci naturally had to participate in this profitable Sci-Fi action trend and it shouldn't come as too much of a surprise that his effort is one of the coolest and most sadistically violent of the entire bunch. In their search for the ultimate crowd-pleasing TV-show, slick studio bosses come up with the brilliant idea of reviving the ancient Roman spectacle of Gladiator fights. Death row prisoners from all over the world are recruited to fight in the arena to the death and, just because every show does better with a celebrity on board, the vicious TV-stations owners frame a popular stunt bike rider with murder, just so that he can be put in the battle as well. But with Drake as their leader and the help of a cute and caring computer expert, the Gladiators fight back! Awesome, undemanding and adrenalin-rushing entertainment from Maestro Fulci, ""The New Gladiators"" offers a spitfire of explosions, macho-showdowns, squeaking bike tires, decapitations, laser beams and revealing manly skirt-outfits! Riz Ortolani delivers one of the best scores of his career (perhaps even second only to his work for ""Cannibal Holocaust"") and Fred Williamson remains the male role model for utter coolness, despite the fact he plays his supportive role on automatic pilot."

You can also count on a third staple present in most of Fulci's work and the factor for which he is probably best remembered; His predilection for incorporating extreme gore scenes into his films (even his non horror efforts such as the film in question) In relation to all of the above, sure enough and true to form, Fulci yet again delivers the goods."
3508,tt0085627,/review/rw2721876/?ref_=tt_urv,"In the future, two TV networks, Seven Seas and WBS (World Broadcasting System) are vying for ever higher ratings. Seven Seas' hottest show is ""Killbike"", where, you guessed it, dudes on strange looking, tricked-out motorcycles beat, slay and decapitate each other, assuming one of them doesn't blow up in the process. WBS' competition to that is ""The Danger Game"", in which contestants think they are facing scary and gruesome situations, but it's all a carefully manufactured hallucination. However, Station Manager Of the Future Cortez (Cassinelli) wants to trump his rivals once and for all, and, because he's based in Rome, decides on a fight-to-the-death biker romp in the coliseum featuring death row criminals sentenced to die, calling it ""The Battle of the Damned"". (Noteworthy cons include Williamson as Abdul and Cliver as Kirk). But, despite their cynicism, in order for this to be a ratings bonanza, they still need a hero. And in order to get a hero, he has to be on death row. So popular good guy Drake (Martin) is framed for his wife's death. With all the pieces seemingly in place, only Drake - perhaps with the help of Sarah (Brigliadori) - can stop the madness and end the ratings wars for good. But can he survive? Not since the late night wars of the early 90's has TV competition been this fierce...say what you want about The New Gladiators, the movie was definitely ahead of its time. It predated the proliferation of reality shows, especially the ones that feed off your fear, such as Fear Factor. (That's all ""The Danger Game"" really is). It predicted the ever-more-vicious competition between networks that leads to the lowest common denominator being aired. It predicted companies conglomerated only in the hands of a few huge concerns. It even predicted reality shows such as ""Full Metal Jousting"". In the movie world, ideas and concepts included in this movie predate Robocop (1987), The Running Man (1987), Strange Days (1995), and Fatal Combat (1995). It even predicted GPS, especially having it on a bracelet you cannot take off, just as criminals have today. All that being said, Rollerball (1975) and Blade Runner (1982) seem to be the major influences. Jared Martin even resembles James Caan.

He is a huge, hulking basso with the ability to near-totally relax his inhibitions, and he uses his entire range, from resonant, snarling low tones, through a thundering midrange up to a piercing, blubbering whimper at the very top which has to be heard to be believed.

I watched ""Sexy Killer"" in a practically sold-out theater at the Brussels International Fantasy Film Festival and the whole audience literally went out of their minds with enthusiasm and delirium. This is a pleasantly deranged, no-barrels-held, unscrupulous and 100% original miscellany of bloody horror and vulgar comedy; easily the most flamboyant movie of its type of the last 10 years or so. Many movies ambitiously try to mix horror and comedy ingredients but miserably fail, whereas ""Sexy Killer"" succeeds without seemingly too much efforts. I won't claim all gags and comical references are equally triumphant, but generally speaking this Spanish movie from director Miguel Martí (""Fin de Curso"") and writer Paco Cabezas (""The Appeared"") is a genuine winner and I hope it will find popularity and distribution outside of the Festival circuit as well. The main trump of the film is undoubtedly lead actress Macarena Gómez and her unique depiction of the eccentric yet lovable protagonist character Barbara. She's a medical student with the vanity and obnoxious ego of Paris Hilton and the homicidal tendencies of Ted Bundy. Barbara addresses to the camera and explains in great detail how she commits the murders and why (kind of like in ""Man Bites Dog"" but even sillier) and she considers herself to be a very normal twenty-something girl with normal needs and desires. She doesn't even need to cover up her serial killing crimes, because who would ever suspect a cute, fragile and cherubic looking student like her? But then our serial killer queen falls in love, and her brainiac-boyfriend just invented a device that brings all of Barbara's murder victims back to life as vengeful zombies. Will she be stolid enough to kill them all again and live happily ever with her boyfriend? Miguel Martí and Paco Cabezas are obviously two completely horror-obsessed geeks, as they processed a massive number of tributes, inside jokes and references towards several classics of the genre into their screenplay. The fact they couldn't decide to make a serial killer movie or a zombie flick and then simply combined the two themes into one demented movie should already say enough about their devotion to the world of horror. ""Sexy Killer"" is an unceasingly entertaining movie, with colorful characters and typical horror clichés that are deliberately magnified to emphasize the comedic effect. There's the stalk-and-slaughter scene at the girls' locker room at the beginning (with a fantastic twist), the zombie resurrecting sequence at the morgue, the fraternity house party turning into a bloodbath near the end and much, much more! The gore effects are explicit, the sleaze is gratuitous and the humor is often crude and tasteless, but yet this movie remains accessible and hilarious at all times. See this film, if possible with friends and a truckload of alcohol and you will have a guaranteed blast."

The flawed plot is a complete mess, without character development, but based on an interesting premise: an original view of reincarnation. Unfortunately, the reason why the villain Bathurst, performed by Chiwetel Ejiofor, does exist is amazingly stupid. Bathurst wants to destroy the mankind and all the living things on Earth since he has been bored of reincarnating for three hundred years. However, he has a bullet that holds the souls of who is shot in a chip, avoiding the soul to reborn and reincarnate again. So why doesn't he commit suicide with this bullet and avoid all the troubles. What is the purpose of existing The Believers other than seek out for the egg to avoid the destruction of life on Earth?

From there on ten years pass as the doctor fixes the disfigured faces of thieves and prostitutes in return for their services in the circus. Well...I am not making this up but the doctor and his renegade circus performers then travel all over Europe and become a huge success. Problems start to happen though as the beautiful female star attractions want out of the circus...and the bed of Diffring...only to find their solace in bizarre deaths...circus-related of course.  One female is killed in a knife-throwing accident while another falls while trapezing.  This is a credulous scenario to be sure, but the film is quite fun.  The acting is good:  Diffring is marvelous as the mad physician plagued with his obsession for perfection in beauty, Donald Pleasance is quite good in a small role, and the female leads are quite stunning...visually of course.  The music is rather hokey...very sixties, but atmosphere is otherwise rather well-staged.  All in all I think I would prefer this over spending my time in a real circus...what a ""real"" horror.

The plot outline is rather ludicrous and far-fetched, I admit, but at least it doesn't slow down for one second and it remains highly imaginative and amusing till the very last sequence. It may be loosely based on (and stolen from) Les Yeux sans Visage, but you can hardly consider that an obstacle anymore, since that masterpiece was such an influence on many movies. Circus of Horrors has more than enough elements to make it stand on its own, as a solid and devoted horror British horror effort. It features a terrific Anton Diffring as an obsessed plastic surgeon. He's forced to flee, after one of his operations went horribly wrong. Due to certain circumstances, he becomes the owner of a traveling circus in France. From then on, he occupies with refurbishing prostitutes and other unfortunate girls before casting them as performers in his circus.

Your wildest imagination doesn't even come close to some of the explicitly shown scenes here. Entire parts of this movie are just plain sick, disgusting, offensive, brutal and they bring you close to puking your guts out. Now, I love horror movies and I am very 'pro-violence', but I do think that it has to lead somewhere !! Is that too much to ask ? Cradle of Fear is just a series of utterly sick and twisted thoughts. The ""movie"" contains out of four separate chapters connected by a wraparound story. This results in endless showing of torture, murder and sickness only to find out that the victims have something in common. Not very informative, if you ask me. And yet - it has to be said - the basic plot idea surely HAS potential. It's about a cannibalistic hypnotist who made a deal with the devil himself to avenge himself and cause misery and death to everyone who was involved in his trial. Personally, I think that is an interesting topic, so they should have focused on that a little more instead of wanting to create the most disgusting movie ever."
3528,tt0291833,/review/rw0827934/?ref_=tt_urv,"The directors cut version, which was the one I saw, was very long for this type of movie. Almost two hours is way too long. If you have the choice, definitely go for the non-directors cut."

The storyline as a whole, I think, is really good (although a little disjointed at times) and the characters were really diverse, the acting wasn't the best I've seen but when is it in a horror movie! although Dani Filth played 'The Man' brilliantly, I couldn't have thought of a better person for the job. It makes you wonder though whether he was really that evil because the people he killed were not exactly nice people. Another thing that added to it's horror movie quality was the low budget special effects, they weren't awful, but you could tell at times that they looked fake. This just makes it better though in my opinion. So on a whole I think this movie is brilliant and it makes a change from the really poor horror movies that have been coming out recently. "
3530,tt8512986,/review/rw4626326/?ref_=tt_urv,"Having followed Fermín Muguruza's music during much of my teenage years, I was quite excited to see what he could do as a film director in Black is Beltza. That is the reason why it pains me to say that this is one of the absolute worse films I have seen in my life, and there is no reason why you should watch it. With the exception of a decent (but not great) soundtrack, everything about Black is Beltza is pathetically bad.
The thing that stands out most from the beginning of the film is the voice acting. It almost seems as if Fermín Muguruza has hired his worst enemy to be the casting director for the film, that is how laughable some of the choices are. One of the main characters, a member of the Black Panthers from New York, is voiced by an (otherwise very talented) actor from the Ivory Coast. Not only does he not have a New York accent; at points it sounds like he struggles to pronounce certain words. Another character, a woman from Cuba, is voiced by a woman who has the emotion and cadence of someone reading out the instructions of her new food processor. Then there is a Texan character voiced by the usually great Sergi López, who is completely unable of pulling a Texan accent. And the highlight: a character from Québec, voiced by an actor who probably doesn't speak a word of French, and who tries to pull off a Québecois accent by combining some awful French with an even worse American accent. Even non-Francophones at my local cinema were laughing out loud at how terrible his accent was.
Another important issue with this film has to do with its portrayal of women and Spaniards - something that is particularly worrying coming from director Muguruza, who has made a career out of preaching about feminism and anti-racism. There are four women with relatively important roles in this film: two of them are only there to sleep with the main character, one of them is an Algerian minister who of course has enormous breasts and a cleavage to match, and an Israeli spy, who barely says anything in the entire film.
Spanish people get an arguably worse treatment from Muguruza. While all Basques in the film are somewhere between nice and heroic, and so are most other characters, Muguruza seems to have a problem with Spaniards. He portrays a Spain full of racist Francoists, who are not only racist and violent but also terribly dumb. Throughout the entire film, not a single Spanish character does or says anything positive, and they are all so one-dimensional that it becomes hard to believe what Muguruza is trying to tell us.
Finally, the story itself is worth mentioning. Mostly because it is just as bad, if not worse, as the voice acting. In one of the first scenes, a man says that the is impressed by the protagonist's boxing skills, even though we have never seen, or heard about, the protagonist boxing. That is the end of the boxing references, but the awful script-writing will follow us throughout the duration of the film. From that moment on, Black is Beltza is a story about a Basque man travelling to the USA, Cuba, Mexico, Algeria and Québec, being welcomed into the highest echelons of revolutionary movements in each location for no apparent reason, and being told by everyone around him that Basques are great and that if the Basques hadn't helped country X, then country X would never have become independent and free like it is today. In the meantime, the protagonist fights and/or runs away from three very bad guys who just happen to come from the three countries that represent Muguruza's particular axis of terror: Spain, the USA, and Israel. And the reason why these characters insist on chasing the protagonist? Muguruza does not feel the need to explain this to the audience, and the closest thing we get to an explanation is that one of the bad guys wants to steal a trumpet from a friend of the main character.
To conclude: if you find yourself thinking about watching Black is Beltza, stop yourself now! This is an awful, awful film, and a total waste of time."

Capriciously leaping to and fro the past and the present of the story, BLACK IS BELTZA often seems to lose its focus, caring much more to add as many iconic names of the 60s as possible to the mix than to deliver a coherent narrative. The character design may appeal for its sharp and almost stark style but the devil-may-care, tough attitude of the hero who is going to save the day is honestly too much to handle in the long run."

They try to make sense of some kind of plot here which is quite excruciating but by the end it's just the usual intercutting of heavily stylised fights between the player characters.

Secondly, it's got a wonderful cast headed up by Henry Silva as a slimy underworld boss who gets a little too ambitious for his own good, robbing a money train and a refinery in broad daylight. Of course one shouldn't overlook Leonard Mann, Adolfo Lastretti, Benito Pacifico, Ottaviano Dell'Acqua and the rest of the regular euro-crime gang that pops by.

This film includes pretty much all the staples that you would expect from an Italian crime flick, and it has to be said that prolific director Mario Caiano has pretty much hit the nail on the head as Weapons of Death features no shortage of car chases, shootouts and cool characters. The plot is just your basic Polizi stuff, and focuses on a city where crime is taking over - with organised robberies becoming the norm. Naturally, the police don't take too kindly to this and it's not long before Captain Beady decides to do something about it and soon identifies gangster Santoro as one of the causes of the problem. However, getting something to pin on Santoro is not all that easy as despite plenty of criminal acts pointing to him - the man always has an alibi.

Reason for this is because I watched the film in Italian language, without any subtitles, but I don't speak Italian at all! In my defense, the film had been standing on my must-see list for an awful long time and the only version available for purchase was this cheap Italian DVD-R without any extras or language options whatsoever. Here's a word of advice: if you ever, like me, assume that you don't necessarily need to understand what's being said in a Poliziotesschi film, think again! Of course these movies are primarily about wild action sequences, explicit violence and guerrilla stunt work, but the plot and the dialogues are still very important! What I did understand is that the ultra-charismatic Henry Silva depicts a real bad SOB! He commits an extremely violent armed train robbery, with naturally lots of civilian casualties, and even organizes a heist on the evidence room of a police station! Leonard Mann is the devoted police detective tailing him, but Silva is the smart and slimy type of gangster who always comes up with a waterproof alibi. Mann is also looking after a clever street kid, to prevent him from becoming a juvenile delinquent. Standard poliziotesschi stuff, in other words, but there were also other things going on in ""Napoli Spara!"" that I couldn't follow properly, like a Maurizio Merli lookalike taxi driver assisting the police and mafia retributions on the parking lot of an illegal casino. I also spotted many familiar themes, like corruption (within the police force as well as in prison), bloody attacks on genitalia and the kicking of pregnant women in the stomach. Auch! But ""Napoli Spara!"" was also released in 1977, and from this year onwards the poliziotesschi began to lose its overwhelming force and impact. There are still many car chases and shootouts, but they are approximately 25% less raw and gritty. To compensate for this, the directors started throwing in comic reliefs, like in this film when Mann's little protégé-kid carjacks a sports car and goes on a joyride through the crowded streets of Naples. He can hardly even reach the pedals or look over the steering wheel, for crying out loud!"

Some of the special effects are dated and look quite cheesy and the flick seems to rely more on blood than genuine scares at times. Also, while by no means terrible, Heather Langenkamp's performance is not quite up to par with her performance in the first 'ELM STREET' and NEW NIGHTMARE. Occasionally it feels like she's phoning it in. These faults don't hurt the movie too much. It's still a enjoyable horror picture that holds up relatively well today. It may not be as good as the first A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, but it's much better than most third installments are. I give it 7/10."

Luckily this film has both, as a French-German coproduction featuring (mostly) actors from all over the world. I mean, you have Karen Allen, which we know from Raiders of the Lost Ark, is dubbed in French and appears to be the main character. Until she doesn't. Then we have Johnny Hallyday, the man who brought rock and roll to France, who's character arc is fascinating because he is a tragic hero for no reason whatsoever. There is Julie Glenn, playing Princess, because why not? Her father wrote the movie. And Gabriel Gabon, who one would recognize from the STNG episode The Bonding more than from anything recent he's done. Finally, Jürgen Prochnow. He's a big, known actor, so we'll give him three roles! And every one of these people are acting, only in different films. There is absolutely no consistency. I half thought that they tried to do three movies, all having Jürgen Prochnow in them, failed, then stitched this together and dubbed it in French for continuity."

This was not a Matrix movie by any stretch of the imagination. Even worse than Reloaded or Revolutions. This was a mess of a movie, and the action scenes made no sense. I don't know who the fight choreographer was, but they must have been sold a bill of goods with whoever they went with. Also, Neo can fight, then he can't, then he can? Also, the action in the other Matrix movies (even the bad ones) you could tell what was going on. This seemed like every time there was a fight scene in this one, they used a lot of shaky cam/quick cuts so the action was incomprehensible. If you are going to bring The Matrix back for another installment after almost 20 years, you had better have something special, as the original Matrix used all the newest technology available at the time to tell an already awesome story. This one, they tried to make action scenes (which were awful) to cover up the fact that they had nothing to add to The Matrix story, and both together were just embarrassing. 5 stars only because Keanu Reeves was in this. I don't know why he agreed to do it, but he was there, I don't think he brought his A game, but he was, in fact, in the movie.

So one of the protagonists brutally bashes in one of the faces of these guys thinking they've killed his girlfriend. She turns up alive and well, so realizing their mistake decide in true horror movie fashion they're not going to say anything or go to the police when they make their way out and home. Did they forget one of their friends just had their faces crushed by a falling log 5 minutes earlier? What's their plan? To just go home and pretend like that didn't happen?

Anybody else of you who first saw it at that age, must know ""Fear No Evil"" tends to stick in your memory. In 2007 I managed to pick up the US Anchor Bay DVD edition and re-watch it. It will always remain very much a flawed affair all the same, but it's a guaranteed fun watch. You'll just have to be able to handle 80's horror cheese. A whole lot of it. ""Fear No Evil"" is a pretty ambitious movie (and the same goes for the story and the orchestrated score). Some tension, sometimes frightening, sometimes shocking but safe to say that most of the time it doesn't make a lick bit of sense. Unbelievable how many songs by 80's bands they managed to put on the soundtrack (great stuff like The Ramones, Talking Heads, Sex Pistols,...). So what do we have here? We've got the Devil incarnated, naked breasts (obviously), angels and demons at play, zombies, some weed-smoking, basket balls that crush & kill, (and for the ladies) we got an all-boys showering scene with all the dudes generously flapping around their ding-dongs (and some male/male kissing with almost deadly consequences).

However, in this film's favor, it does fill in some of the logic gaps of the previous films, answering some persistent lingering questions in this prequel of the first ever limited Purge on Staton Island, Are people really so depraved to go on killing rampages one day a year? How could the economy and crime rates improve as a result of a yearly purge? Who would benefit from such an event? Much is explained in this installment. The totalitarian New Founding Fathers need this first purge to be a success, so when the brown and poverty stricken residents of Staten Island don't riot and kill, they send in a Blackwater type of group to make sure there are plenty of killings in hopes of turning citizens against one another. When the leader of the Blackwater group is a dead ringer or Ronny Regan, it's not hard to guess where this film's politics lie and the filmmakers opinion of our current president and his divisive style of politics for personal enrichment (At one point, the heroine refers to one of her attackers as a ""pussy-grabber,"" a pretty direct Trump reference.). As with the other films, this one follows a disparate group of folks trying to survive the 12-hour Purge, primarily an anti-purge activist and a community minded drug kingpin. The downside to this film is similar to the others, in that there is not a lot of character development and despite a strong film concept and story set-up, the film quickly devolves into a series of action set pieces. I found this to be the weakest of the series when it came to action and suspense, but it's likely the strongest when it comes to better fleshing out the politics and the logic behind the purge. I'm also disappointed that the series is straying pretty significantly from it's horror roots in the first film and is more and more becoming an urban action film series. The first two films did an excellent job of conveying the frightening anarchy of the purge (the first film was a straight-up horror home invasion story), but subsequent films has felt more action oriented. I much preferred the uncompromising horror of the first films, which seemed to delve more into the darkness of human nature, even if the logic of the purge was less intelligible. Series creator James DeMonaco is only the writer this time and leaves the directing duties to Gerard McMurray, who does a serviceable job, but this film felt less apocalyptic and less surreal than the prior films, somewhat to it's detriment. After having watched this film and having started watching the 10 episode TV event, I think The Purge series needs to either become more political (which this film did more so) or more focused on simply presenting interesting scenarios and chaos (which the TV show is doing more of), but I keep feeling like there's not enough of either in any of these films."

The cast give long meaningful looks at each other, the only trouble is the specific meaning of the look is utterly lost due to bad acting and worse writing. Take a drink every time they did this and you'd not last to the end of the film. The shark action is very minimal. Mostly the movie consists of people in a raft being utterly dumb. Seriously, they don't unpack the survival box until the second day in the boat. They don't conserve the water when it rains, despite having no bottled water left. Every single time the shark attacks they all stand up, the women scream and then they all fall overboard because they are standing. Even when they get to some rusting hulks in the water which are entirely stable, when they see the shark the women scream and fall over into the water. That was my favourite bit.

The most famous films are American, like ""Dirty Harry"" starring Clint Eastwood and ""The French Connection"" starring Gene Hackman, but over in Europe there was quite a vast number of nasty cop thrillers as well. Most of them were made in Italy, obviously, but the French had Jean-Paul Belmondo! He depicts the ideal macho copper who – dressed in a leather jacket and jeans – singlehandedly pulverizes the Paris-Marseille drug cartel. I'm not at all familiar with Belmondo's work (or at least, not yet) but he boosts the exact right balance between arrogance and utter coolness. Belmondo plays the Parisian police commissioner Philippe Jordan, sent to Marseille to help the local police force with deconstructing the drug business led by Mr. Meccacci. Jordon's methods are effective but slightly nonconformist, like throwing 200kg heroine into the sea. Due to Meccacci's political influences, Jordon is transferred back to Paris, but as a desk clerk in a sleazy red light district. Still he doesn't give up his battle against Meccacci, especially not when his henchmen annihilate one of Jordan's personal friends. There are some impressive action sequences, like the helicopter vs. the speedboat sequence and the wild chase through Paris with an awesome and bulletproof Ford Mustang. The fact that J.P. Belmondo apparently did all of his stunt work himself makes it even more impressive, as some of that stuff looked quite dangerous. The great and heavily underrated Henry Silva portrays the relentless drug baron/super villain, but he's criminally underused and his voice is horribly dubbed. The score is nice but not exceptional and definitely not Ennio Morricone's best work. Overall I certainly cannot say I was displeased with my very first acquaintance with Jean-Paul Belmondo and I'm already curious to check out the other film of his I have lying around; ""The Professional""."
3607,tt0085900,/review/rw3076414/?ref_=tt_urv,"This is really nothing very special but tells its story efficiently enough and is packed with action. Some time after about the halfway mark, I began to get a little restless as we went through yet another rather predictable punch up but then the film changes gear and we are off to a laid back but pleasing denouement. Belmondo is great throughout, aged 50 at the time and if he really did do all those stunts as we are told it is remarkable. What with crossing motorways and dodging the traffic and leaping out of trains and a helicopter and the impressive Paris car chase, this is one massive performance and still remaining his iconic self with that twinkle in the eye. Henry Silva, five years older than Belmondo has less to do but still helps give the film its gravitas. The Morricone score is fine and even sounds really 80's at times, although I'm not sure that's a good thing. Plenty of attractive location shooting in both Marseille and Paris and plenty also of pretty girls along the way. Nothing profound here but a well made and tough action movie."

Still, it's entertaining movie for action or cop movie fans. At time of original release this was an excellent action film, but for time being action movies are at totally new level. Therefore don't expect too much. This movie has some good points thought. First of all, we see very good starting actor, young Tchéky Karyo here. Second, for car fans there is a car chase scene with Ford Mustang. Third, Belmondo makes his own stunts. Quite interesting is also to watch the first orange bullet train speeding in France! It's a little nostalgic to see this movie. I would say that after every 15 years or so, it is fun to see it again"
3610,tt10954652,/review/rw7399807/?ref_=tt_urv,"M. Night Shyamalan is such a fascinating director, you never know what you're going to get with him.

Old boasts an original concept and sumptuous cinematography (by Mike Gioulakis), but the writing and performances fail to see it through.

It falls into a lot of some of our most 'loved' clichés like: the chosen one, the girl who is different and can take care of herself, the bully becomes friend and so on, there was a point un the movie when I was already wondering what the next cliché to appear would be.
The movie actually looks quite well, it has some great shots and frames that were really well done, some scenes really are disturbing in the middle of this inconsistent story and I think they really can save this film, at least a little.
The characters were, in my opinion, so annoying and dislikeable because of how cartoonish and unreal they can be, from the start of the movie I hated our 'hero' from almost the start until the very last second, no matter how much the movie tries to make me believe he has grown or something, he is just the same plain and maleable to conveniente character he was from the start."

This is a second work of Kiah Roache-Turner (""Wyrmwood""), and most of his style also appears here. That means - lots of action, decent amount of blood and guts, comic-style characters, and cheesy dialogues. The good news is all of this works good in this kind of movie.
The basic concept (Nekromancers vs. Demons) looks like ""Ghostbusters"", but with an R-rating. There's also references to horror classics (such as ""Hellraiser"" and ""Exorcist""), but not much. The acting is not the most attractive side of this film (Monica Bellucci is clearly overacting, but I'm sure that's the point here), so just foeget about it. Enjoy the little things. Like old-fashioned SFX (less CGI, more good prosthetics), pretty girls with guns, and good soundtrack. I mean - where else you can see slime-covered badass girl killing demon-possessed people with ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" by wonderful Andy Williams on the background?
Yes, zero character development. Yes, really bad jokes. But if you're looking for a bloody and fast-paced mix of a horror, action and comedy - you're on the right way."

It feels as though it started life as something entirely unrelated and, if that is the case, it honestly should've stayed that way. Most, though not all, of the movie's issues stem from the fact that it reframes an antagonist as an anti-hero without giving much thought as to the implications of this shift. Though there is the the germ of a good idea at the core of this picture, the almost interesting underlying concept ultimately isn't done any justice. Rather than focusing on an innocent young girl caught between two irredeemably violent factions, it opts to create a scenario in which her safety is entirely in the hands of one particular party. Any potential for a morally grey and challenging affair is thrown out of the window in favour of a more straightforward thriller that jumps through several hoops just to paint its protagonist as someone worth rooting for. Even then, it only manages to make him the 'hero' by default. Because of this, the emotional climax of the piece falls flat on its face. After all, just because we've had our arm twisted into aligning with someone doesn't mean we actually care about them. To be fair, it does attempt to make its audience unsure as to whom they're supposed to be supporting, sewing seeds of doubt at the halfway point and almost promising that the latter half will turn into the aforementioned morally grey and challenging affair. Instead, it takes a sledgehammer to its ambiguity and is all the worse for it. It isn't just the fact that the villain of 'Don't Breathe (2016)' is now the hero that makes you wish the two films weren't connected, it's that this later effort feels nothing like its predecessor and features a number of frustrating inconsistencies that feel as though they're the result of bad writing rather than off-screen character development. I mean, the movie almost forgets its protagonist is blind at one point (or, at least, that he isn't Daredevil). This really would've been better off as its own thing, and I think general audiences would be reacting to it slightly more favourably if that was the case. There's a huge difference between a character alluding to a previous history of monstrous behaviour and actually having first-hand knowledge of those actions - actions which are all the more discomforting due to their relative realism, overtly intrusive nature and general heinousness (let's just say we aren't dealing with someone like Boba Fett here). Despite its plentiful problems, though, the picture does have genuine merits. Its structure essentially means that it is comprised of a preamble, an extended second-act set-piece and an extended finale. The latter two elements are genuinely rather good, entertainingly bouncing between blunt brutality and suspenseful sneakiness. The set-pieces are well-shot, convincingly choreographed and suitably engaging. They're enjoyable and do pretty much exactly what they need to. The film is at its best when nobody is speaking (the writing is noticeably poor throughout the entire experience), but even then it lacks the context to be compelling or affecting beyond a surface level. The flick isn't terrible overall, but it is a bit baffling. It's bad, but it's relatively enjoyable, which I guess means it isn't bad? Whether that makes sense or not, I can't deny that the feature is (somehow) fairly entertaining, thanks both to its set-pieces and to its oddities (which are fun to tear into with a friend). Ultimately, it's far worse than its predecessor, but it's just about successful enough to be worth watching if any of what I've said peaks your interest. 6/10."

You literally can't make a descent horror film without getting slaughtered by couch critics. I didn't think it was that bad. The storyline wasn't the greatest but it worked. It had some brutal kill scenes and the main character was awesome once again. Stephen Lang's performance alone is more then enough reason to check it out. 7 stars.
3660,tt6246322,/review/rw7327628/?ref_=tt_urv,"A decent sequel to the 1st one with the protagonist being the only character coming back with a fresh story which is not directly related to the 1st one. As I expected from the trailer this one is a taut and well made thriller with the key setup being similar to the 1st film. The film is enjoyable throughout although it does goes down in some places along the story. Cinematography is very cool and gives great angles to the viewers. The story, screenplay and writing are good. Editing is crisp and the music lends solidarity to the overall setting of the film. I'm not sure this sequel was necessary because frankly both films don't connect apart from just the character of the protagonist. But I could see this as a redemption arc for the protagonist's character briefly. All in a this is a good film and you will enjoy watching this one. The 1st film was miles better though."

Choose or Die might not be the greatest movie ever, we can all agree on that, but to me it was certainly good enough to entertain me the whole time. Nice refreshing story, with good ideas, and a decent production. I thought Lola Evans and Asa Butterfield, playing the two main characters, did a pretty good convincing job. As a fan of retrogaming it was even nicer to watch, reminded me of my youth sometimes. So in conclusion, if you want something else in the mild horror genre Choose or Die is a nice option."

He can only stop playing if he makes copies of the game; he does so. Three months later protagonist Kayla finds the game along with a note stating that the first person to beat it will win $125,000 and a phone number, which gives a recorded message suggesting it might be unclaimed. Her friend, computer programmer Isaac, helps her start to play. Again her in game choices have real world consequences; attempts to stop playing or destroy the tape don't work; if she tries to avoid making a choice it tells her to 'Choose or Die'! Things will get increasingly unpleasant as Kayla learns more about the game and its origins before inevitably facing 'The Boss' level."

A sprawling ensemble cast are efficient in their roles, some funnier than others, but sadly the wit tends to be bypassed in favour of dumber sex or vomit gags. I did enjoy the dancing scenes and the CGI jokes, however."

There are a lot of funny scenes, absurd sometimes but does everything has to be that serious all the time? They clearly made more than once fun of the pandemic and that was also nice to see there are still people that are not completely paranoid or just don't give a toss about the whole brainwashing we got. Plus the cast was very well chosen for this movie. I liked almost everybody if not everybody. They all did a good job, added something different to the story, and were all funny.

Tse is his former good-cop buddy, who has become really good at being really bad for reasons we learn along the way. Many of these films are thrown together with a muddled plot that exists only to set up their action sequences. Here we have a shining exception, as main characters and their backstories are fleshed out to fine advantage, making for a production that satisfies the brain as well as fulfilling the desired adrenalin quota."

I don't think this movie would be allowed to be released in China, 'cause most of the incidents happened in a north-east China city. Both South Korean and Japanese were involved in non-stop battles against each other, trying to get a top secret from the North Korean chief of intelligence. The acting part from the South Korean actors were absolutely great. The screenplay was also carried out perfectly. All the fighting scenes also looked quite real and seamless. This movie also carried a hidden message that both North Korea and South Korea seemed to realize neither Japanese nor American government would like to have a unified Korea and, of course, neither CCP China like North Korea united with South Korea. This hidden message is just an open secret that most of the people in the world, except those naive ones, already knew such fact. This is a very unique and exciting thriller, even it's a bit absurd, still highly recommended."

This sequel is a loud and frantic mess, where superpowers can do whatever the plot demands, characters don't care about consistency, and the same jokes are repeated a dozen times. If you liked the first Venom movie, you'll probably like this one. I didn't, so I don't."
3683,tt7097896,/review/rw7408607/?ref_=tt_urv,"Marvel and DC these days remind me of those big players of the worldwide cheeseburger ""distribution network"" - the products always taste the same, because the ingredients are always accurately of the same nature and made the same way. Always. The same applies these days to those entertainment companies - you already know what to expect if a new show or movie leaves the factories of those big players of genetic movie engineering. Venom: Let There Be Carnage is not a candidate for the worst movie categories nor a total bore or fail, it is just a part of that endless and constant stream of ""entertainment"" these factories produce: easy to consume, easy to forget. Long gone are the times when I heard people talking about a new movie or show of those ""big"" players. Disappointed? No, it's just business as usual."
3684,tt7097896,/review/rw7578978/?ref_=tt_urv,"At least 'Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021)' is brief. That's pretty much the only praise I can send its way. I mean, it's genuinely terrible. Frankly, it's almost unfathomable how a team as talented as this can turn out something so amateurish. It honestly feels unfinished. Having said that, it's actually difficult to properly review, because it's just... well, nothing. It's not even boring. It's totally empty, a meal comprised of zero calories. It's also insanely forgettable. If you asked me to recount its plot beat for beat, even while the credits were still rolling, I'd seriously struggle to come up with a coherent answer. As I said, it's difficult to properly review. Perhaps that's because reflecting on it is like trying to remember a bad dream; by the time you try to articulate it, it has already slipped from your mind. Perhaps it's because it leaves you feeling totally apathetic, unequipped to even think about its events, never mind its shortcomings. Perhaps it's because the flick is genuinely less boring than many movies deserving of a similar, or even marginally better, rating, but also genuinely worse than most of those same movies. A bad movie is better than a boring one, I suppose, but a movie that leaves you feeling nothing, not even annoyance, is surely the bottom of the barrel. It goes in one ear and straight out of the other. It's awful, but I can't bring myself to get worked up about it. I'm aware that I haven't even begun to delve into its cavalcade of issues, but I just can't bring myself to do so. That in itself says a lot. I'm totally ambivalent about the piece. It isn't fun, but it isn't boring; it isn't competent, but it isn't offensive; it isn't anything, but it isn't... well, anything. In the end, it will leave you feeling like Venom himself: hungry for something with a brain. Heck, even a bar of chocolate would be more fulfilling. 3/10."

The entire movie is filler stalling for its final battle, yet that showdown is disappointing. Yes, it is between two marketable comic book characters, but that's all it provides. The villain is underdeveloped and uninteresting, the imagery is sloppy and cluttered, and the choreography is nonsensical. Because there is no coherent style or vision, the sequence ends up being a big, ugly mess. Normally, the details of an action sequence wouldn't be so significant, but that's all this film invests in."

They invited Michael back in for the 4th sequel and back into the story of Halloween. Even though I did enjoy the 3rd sequel, I do agree that I missed Michael. He's my favorite boogeyman, so it'd be cool to see him return and do what he does best, slice and dice and scare the heck out of me. Well is this really scary? Not too much, but still it's a fun sequel to get into and watch in the dark. I like the story and how they are continuing into the Myer's past and how far Michael will go to destroy this blood line. Although I was disappointed to not have Laurie Strode in this one, it was interesting to see how her legacy lives on with her daughter and now she will have the struggle with Michael Myers."

Set ten years after the first two films (#2 was filmed in 1981, but set immediately after #1 in 1978), THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS opens with the infamous killer being transfered between psyhiciatric hospitals. Naturally, he escapes, and, tipped off that he has a niece (daugther of the now-deceased Jamie Lee Curtis character) living in Haddonfield, sets out to find her. Hot on his trail, as always, is Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence). After some were turned off by the more-gruesome deaths in HALLOWEEN 2, this film is more in-line with the original, relying more heavily on suspense and honest scares than blood and gore. For a nine-year-old, Harris delivers a good performance, and Donald Pleasence (as usual) is also good, with a performance that lets you know this is a been-there-don't-want-to-go-through-that-again character. Director Dwight H. Little brings a sense of atmosphere to the film and creates a number of suspenseful scenes. Thankfully, the make-shirt mob of gun-toting beer-guzzlers isn't as bad as it could have been. HALLOWEEN 4 is one of the best of the series."

I want Bond to be swedging with villains and interacting with hot babes on a regular basis. What I don't want is Bond rabbiting on about his feelings for nearly three hours. Now, you may think I am a philistine who can't appreciate believable drama with my thrills. But the thing is that all this naval gazing which is supposed to make the character so 'real' is still co-existing with totally unrealistic action and sci-fi super-weapons. It's a case of wanting your cake and eating it too. Over-the-top action and plots don't combine at all well with constant whining. The counter argument would be if when Ken Loach made his kitchen sink drama 'Up the Junction' he had decided to include exploding helicopters and robots. If that had happened, the critics would be up in arms, saying that, while they admired the gritty presentation of working class people's lives, they were disappointed with Loach's decision to include a robot laser battle at the conclusion. Well, those self-same critics are the ones who are applauding the idea that Bond can infiltrate an evil genius's secret base, while taking time out to mope around and feel a bit sad while doing it. I'm not having it. If you can't have cyborgs in a Ken Loach drama then you sure as hell can't have a Bond with mental health issues."

The movie looks great with terrific location photography, the title is cool and Bond girls Lea Seydoux and Ana de Armas are wildly dreamy. Other than that, this movie has little to offer. The story isn't that interesting and the villain is weak. If there wasn't a lady in the theater (AMC Westbury, NY) laughing once in a while, I wouldn't have even noticed the jokes. It's also about twenty minutes too long. ""No Time to Die"" bites the hand that feeds it. It is, hands down, the worst movie of Daniel Craig's not-so-hot tenure as James Bond."

A production of Charles Bands' Empire Pictures, it's got a cool, gnarly monster, a decent cast, some gore and some suspense, and lots of impressive horror themed comic book art.

But, being the huge Tales From the Crypt (if you see the movie you'll know what I'm babbling about) fan that I am, the movie had an impact on me.  Cellar Dweller is a very loving tribute to the EC comics that are cherished by many a horror fan.  It's also a John Carl Buechler film and he created the Ghoulies.  That explains why the Cellar Dweller is simply an oversized Ghoulie (some people even say that he's cute).  I spent quite some time looking for this movie and gave up.  It's one of those movies you see when you're a kid watching Showtime after midnight and you never expect to see it again (especially since you don't remember the title).  Then you run across it in a ghetto Blockbuster years later and you realize that this is the movie you've been looking for, and, indeed, one of your heroes is in it.

I think the rating is a bit harsh, this story brought us back into the story with Jamie, even though a warning in advance, she does get killed off with this sequel, I liked how they continued the story with one of the original characters, Tommy Doyle.

He eliminates anyone (including women) who question his authority, making resident and younger brother Jan-Michael Vincent really sorry he ever asked for his help. Thoughtless and mean-spirited action-thriller from writer-director George Armitage has good location shooting in Simi Valley, CA but an utterly unsympathetic script filled with redneck clichés and ugly violence. Armitage has managed to gather together a most curious supporting cast for the film, including Victoria Principal, Bernadette Peters, Loni Anderson in a bit part, Andrew Stevens, David Doyle, Brad Dexter and Paul Gleason. Unfortunately, the center of the whole thing is Kristofferson, who is despicable throughout. Even viewed as a tacky co-feature or drive-in entry, ""Vigilante Force"" is a nasty piece of work, and one with a ridiculous climax. * from ****"

It has the distinct directorial style of Sam Raimi with some quirky camera choices, horror elements and quick montages. The fight scenes and magic are more creative than in previous films, such as the musical battle. The visual design of the universes are very distinct and feels like other worlds have really come to life. It was very exciting to explore other worlds and other versions of Dr. Strange.

Whew!  It has one of the cruelest, unsympathetic protagonists in film, played with aplomb and panache by an overlooked Michael Gough.  This man is on cruise control along his evil highway to glory and sexual satisfaction, at one point shooting his house cat at close range rather than have it possibly ruining his scientific discovery.  Gough is incredible and his performance is worth a look at the film alone.  The other actors are credible and the guy in the ape suit is believable  till the last act.

It was charming, well-acted and coherent, so it was also simply well-written.

The last part of the grand master came years later. ""Scream 4"" (2011) was not quite in the jolt of the original, and incidentally designed as such, trilogy, but was still entertaining and the signature of the director was still noticeable and valuable.

Yeah, that's every decade! Lol. Next, how is Sam a full 5 years older than her sister and group of friends when she looks the same age as them? She's supposed to be like early 20s and they all look early 20s. Sam's age doesn't line up. Billy got her mother pregnant and died in 1996, so she should be at least 26.

Belgians don't make a lot of movies but when they do it's most of the time good if not excellent, and so is this one, a good fast paced gore movie à la Braindead.

These Undead spring back into action, eating people alive before thy can turn, one charging along on his stumps like the Knight from Monty Python, there's a great shot of a Zombie horde on the skyline. Francoites link up with Republicans against the common enemy. Everything from a partisan band, to ordinary fascists, a Nun (with a big gun), a young woman called Priest Killer, atheists, communists and muslims unite to do battle with the walking dead. The squabbling between the assorted characters gets a tad tiresome at times, maybe ten minutes of this excised from the movie would have made it a better film. Still, the individual characters are interesting, especially Priest Killer and Brodsky who identifies as a Russian (he reckons he was brought to Spain as a baby). Homage is paid to Night of the Living Dead with a Zombie attack on a farmhouse and a train scene which is straight out of Train to Busan. Along with other Undead epics.

This small tribe from which she belongs has a talented fighter who will stop at absolutely nothing to get her back.

The movie doesn't even really have a plot, just tries to make a excuse for some blood and gore. I am usually forgiving when it comes to movies like this but the plot holes were just way too noticeable. And it never tells or shows why the killer does what he does, he just goes around filming everyone of his kills while wearing a chrome skull mask. It had a strong start though, it was actually pretty creepy but after the first scene it quickly ran out of it's flair. A young woman waking up inside of locked casket with no memory of who she is or how she got there is a unoriginal but cool concept, but after that first scene the suspense dies. I thought it would have a cool build up and a decent twist, but the twist was actually pretty stupid as well. You just end up wanting the chrome skull killer to kill everyone, cause like I said I am forgiving but the characters or victims are just too damn stupid. I guess it's worth a look though for major slasher fans or if your in a appetite for slaughter."

This time the kills are a bit more gruesome for this sequel but it also seemed like they just put in bunch of random character for ChromeSkull to kill. And that basically sums up most of this movie for the most part. If you have a weak stomach though it's just better to stay away from this if you do cause there is almost nothing in the story department. The acting is even more atrocious this time and almost laughable at times than actually makes the premise intimidating. There is more weapons that is used to gruesomely kill people but the only audience I can see really enjoying this movie. Is the audiences that like to watch people die in some of the most gruesome way possible with sharp objects. Although I seen similar movies like this before but even I had to cringe a few times while watching this. Also the mystery behind ChromeSkull is what sort of made the videotaping killer sort of interesting and this movie reveals a bit of ChromeSkull and who he is. I am not sure if this is a good thing but the premise is even more ridiculous this time around. And not only because ChromeSkull manage to survive the first incident, it just makes the killer more supernatural than human. Okay so it is now revealed that ChromeSkull is like some leader in some creepy secret organization. Although it isn't clearly explained what that organization is about. Like I said there is little to no script for this movie and to sum it up, it's a sadistic gruesome killing movie. But there is audiences for this type of movie so if your one of them this movie might be worth a watch with a group of friends that share the same interest. I personally just found this sequel to be gruesome but bland. The movie sort of picks up near the end and than fall short again because it just becomes too ridiculous and stupid."

However as with Hatchet 2 it would seem the promise seen in the first movie has fallen by the wayside. The opening scenes with what appears to be government agents or some clandestine organisation coming to the rescue was a good idea but the execution was terribly amateurish the shaky cam just didn't work and what the hell was it with the acting of the minion in the glasses it was as if he was reading his line of a dummy card. Being a low budget slasher movie I gave it the benefit of the doubt but it didn't get any better. There appeared to be no plot no motivation for this organisation, I get that Chromeskull is one sick puppy but what the hell were these people doing helping him It was never explained. The police made one ridiculous move after another and one of the lead characters literally just disappears what the hell happened to him?

They get drunk, accidentally kill a man, and are joined by another girl who carries razor blade in the bag to slash people with.

The less you know of the plot, the better. Unfortunately, the video box art and synopsis give away the shock ending. Shame on the marketing department! I could've also done without the opening Indian scene. The acting runs the range from top notch to over-the-top ridiculous, which in my book, works for me. Chuck Conners delivers all the great one-liners in the movie. Marc Singer steals just about every scene with his whacked-out performance. And Anthony Geary holds the whole thing together. There are some unintentional laughs to be had to be sure, which again, in my book works. The story is cool and the symbolism is excellent- especially the very ending. This one definitely falls under the ""psychotronic"" category. I'd recommend this with a double feature of Project Nightmare, which is also in a similar vein and worth seeing."
3803,tt0087130,/review/rw2411322/?ref_=tt_urv,"This low-cost Canadian produced presentation is reasonably ordinary, but for its type not as terrible as it's made out to be. This is one of those films that the cover artwork always made it look quite interesting, but the synopsis on the back had less of an affect. A friend of mine convinced me to watch it, after the first half-hour I could see why because the story does such a great job setting up the highly-charged, innovative predicament (three astronauts in space watch on as world war three erupts with nuclear attacks on Earth) to only lose its way when a couple months later they crash-land back on earth then it becomes a very vanilla-like post-apocalyptic Sci-fi wasteland survival outing (of the very cheap, rancid b-grade kind) with some very unbelievably trite villains that come off more as joke than anything truly threatening. The head honcho played by Kevin King seemed more suited in a ""Save by the Bell"" episode, than as a ruthlessly imposing leader. At times I was waiting for cued laughter from an audience whenever he was on screen, as he came off more so a brat. Just as poor was Tim Choate in the leading role. Well more so eccentrically annoying. I found the support to be much better; Kate Lynch, Lenore Zann (running around in a school uniform), Maury Chaykin and John Walsch. The opening first half-hour is very well pulled off; with some striking visuals, solid set-designs and usefully gripping details. You could see where all the money went in to, but that could probably explain its weakly conceived abrupt ending. Maybe that had run out. Anyhow during its grounded action, it does create some nasty touches, edgy activity and cement an ugly intensity. Too bad it just too daft (simply lacking the colourful craziness) and at times incoherent. The story is straight-forward, although the script is flimsy and too black and white to make it completely fulfilling. Minimally junky and grim, if particularly plain post-nuke entertainment."
3804,tt0087130,/review/rw1798924/?ref_=tt_urv,"Let's get it out of the way first thing: The critics of the 80s like Leonard Maltin and Siskel/Ebert who sadistically maligned DEF-CON 4 as a wretched exercise in scum & sleaze were WRONG. I agree with another comment stating that this movie was unfairly dismissed at the time of original release. Yes it's tacky, low budget and amoral -- perhaps one of the most amoral movies of the Reagan years of home video rental. For that reason alone it actually stood out from the pack by actually daring to present it's viewers with exactly that which it aspired to. Unlike the Mad Max films or even the Italian ripoffs of the genre Max created, DEF-CON 4 has no presumptions about being a parable, having any kind of a message or examining some sort of social phenomenon. It is about nuclear war and the resultant breakdown of our North American collective society, and like those prospects it isn't pretty, easy to stomach or even make sense of."

Other times, not so much. Enter Whiskey Mountain. Of course it has nothing to do with Moonshine Mountain. Why would it? Whiskey Mountain is more like a semi-ripoff of Deliverance, (allegedly) for the Drive-In crowd, with a positively uncalled for PG rating. A quality which doesn't really hold back this Hixploitation epic as much as one would assume. I guess you could call it a hard PG. However, I must say I expected a tad more from something that came from William Grefe, as I found this obscurity to be slightly underwhelming. Whiskey Mountain is about 2 Bikers, I mean 2 motorcyclists (along with the wives), who end up making some local pot farmers nervous, after they head out to said mountain, lookin' for gold. So, they ain't lookin' for weed, but the farmers don't know that. A very, very long weekend is what follows. The vicious hicks, by no means, intend on letting these people go. Besides an entertaining performance from the legendary William Kerwin, and some quaint scenery, here and there, there ain't a whole lot for Whiskey Mountain to brag about. Perhaps if good ol' Jeffery Allen had been present, there would have been a little more life in this shin-dig. It's just too normal and serious for it's own good. Not Grefe's best, by any means. You may just want to check out Electric Shades Of Grey, and call it a day. Or, if you must discover some 70's Hixploitation that no one cares about, you might be better off with something more like God's Bloody Acre. However, for you vintage/obscure/exploitation completists out there, you could go whole a lot worse than Whiskey Mountain. I say give it a chance.

It's a little off-putting having a downright farcical movie in an established cinematic universe. Thor: Love and Thunder is about as grounded as a Naked Gun movie, but for some reason the comedy rarely hits for me, where I can enjoy it in an actual spoof. I was surprised, despite the nearly constant attempts at humor, the crowded theater I was in rarely did more than chuckle. If they're going to make a straight-up comedy then they need it to be more laugh-out-loud funny. Of course comedic taste is extremely subjective, so I'm sure some people enjoy laughing along.

Although this movie only using street fighting as its martial art, they forget to hire any choreographer! We can see that all action scene here just use some random punch and kick here and there without any art, just like the director or the actor who know nothing about fighting choreographed the fight scene, which is really important for this movie. Even the names are not memorable and stylish at all, we still can remember Genji and Serizawa and it feel so good and cool to saying their name.

It was an enjoyable movie when it comes down to it. Sure its really quite violent and gory but you do expect that from a horror type film. It was also pretty darn sad when you think of it and what drove these old people to murder was because basically they have lost all hope in life of someone taking care of them. The acting was ok in this and i felt especailly the daughter held her own and was very brave. The direction worked well but i will say the script could be improved in areas. Apart from that though not a bad nextflix horror film.
3841,tt21933110,/review/rw8606731/?ref_=tt_urv,"I'm surprised to see this one being uprated because I thought it was diabolically bad. It's the latest digital horror to hit Netflix, this time German, but if you're thinking of something approaching the quality of recent TV show DARK then think again: this is bargain basement from beginning to end. The story is about a virus that transforms old people into slavering monsters, as evinced in the first scene in which a carer finds an unwelcome surprise in the home of one of her clients. But what follows is cheap, grey, too dark, entirely generic, with the oldsters pretty much depicted as zombies. Some violence, plenty of goo and gross-out moments, but zero suspense or viewer involvement."

In the past we had some horror films where it was question of killer kids, for instance a Spanish movie from the late seventies; Spanish cinema and its obsession for kids in horror films. I am sure we will see more features like this one in the future. But this topic could have been written in a different way, not necessarily in a more or less Hollywood style."

This movie hadn't a big budget but also far away from the smallest of this B-Movie Fantasy kind. The dialogs were quite simple and cheesy but not too stupid. It had some moments. I liked the music, it was old-school Fantasy/Sci-Fi Music. The second half of the movie could have been shorter in my opinion because it did not happen that much there. Cameraman did a good job, probably one of the most skilled people who worked on this movie. I wanted some fantasy-like stuff and I got it (which isn't really easy nowadays) and it entertained me, not on the highest level possible but it was enough to fulfill my need of watching fantasy stuff, so if you have that need as well you should give it a try."

(If you've ever seen the original ""Children of the Corn"", you'll know what I mean.) The fight scenes here are SO incredibly lame. I've seen 2nd graders stage better mock combats in school plays. It doesn't help that the script seems to have been written by a moronic middle-schooler. No cliché goes unturned here, no mundane sword-&-sorcery trope untouched. I read the first three of John Norman's 'Gor' books when I was in high school and much more interested in the genre, and even then I didn't think that they were anything special. But at least they held my attention for the first few books in the series (probably mainly because of the sexy Boris Vallejo covers and the stories' liberal doses of bondage-themed sex). This movie has none of those elements. The only two good things about it are the vigorous, hearty (and often inappropriately utilized - good job, Fritz, you inept stooge) musical score and Rebecca Ferrati's breasts.

Why? Well, the Gor books, for those of you who haven't had the pleasure, or pain, can be summed up as follows: Conan with pornography. Each and every novel was chock full of porn, sado-masochism and bondage. In short, a ""raging-hormone-male-teenager's"" wet dream. Hidden amongst the sleaze and thinly-veiled attempts to make the reader think of women as nothing but objects, there are actually some pretty good action-adventure stories.

Or perhaps because I have a tremendous weakness for equally obscure and similarly themed flicks from the 1980's, like ""TAG: The Assassination Game"", ""Master Blaster"" and ""The Zero Boys""? All these flicks share the same plot, namely that a dim-witted but fun shootout game turns deadly when one or more participants start using real ammunition. None of them are to be considered genre classics, or even remotely great films for that matter, but they nonetheless provided pure and unpretentious entertainment. Entertainment is also exactly what I wanted to get out of ""Paintball"", but apparently that was too much to ask for  It's truly a dire effort, with an utterly dumb and implausible plot, and sadly also severely lacking gore, brutality and fast-paced suspense/excitement. ""Paintball"" is a European production – more specifically a Spanish one – and the creators obviously wanted to further exploit the worldwide impression that ALL Europeans are psychopathic butchers with a fetish for torturing Americans. Hence we're getting some kind of ridiculous mixture between the aforementioned 80's titles and Eli Roth's ""Hostel"". A bunch of people are in the back of a shaky truck, heading out to the remote Redwoods area and preparing themselves for a large-scaled and allegedly super-deluxe paintballing contest. Upon their first confrontation with another team already, it becomes clear that they are all defenseless puppets in much more sadistic and profitable game, run from an illegal control room somewhere in the city. It's kind of a dumb twist, if you ask me, but even more imbecilic than the plot are the totally bland and unremarkable characters. Each and every single member in the group of protagonists irritated me enormously, what with their whining and selfishness, and I literally wished for none of them to survive the ordeal. Director Daniel Benmayor also thought it would be a good idea to film all the killings from POV angle and through a sort of unclear brown camera filter. Result: the killings are hectically shot and extremely dull. There's nearly not enough bloodshed or cruelty for die-hard horror fanatics, let alone the admirers of the nowadays popular torture porn genre. The film doesn't take enough advantage of the sublime forestry filming locations and we don't learn enough about the actual villains that are running the show. ""Paintball"" a complete failure across all departments."

It's a good effort but of course he tried to combine other movies in his flick. It's a kind of survival flick with a mix of torture porn. So far so good but when it comes to the slaughtering he decided to do it from first person view. No probs but he showed it to us in the style predator/terminator but with colorless and negative viewing. So suddenly the blood turns white or grey and that doesn't work at all. It works for some shots but almost all killings are from the killer's point, a bit too much. It's not too gory, and there is some suspense but if he only had added the right color for the RED stuff well, it would have been much better. The storyline is very simple, some things aren't really explained but still, it's not that bad, one to see and probably forget."

Pleasence played an Irish man but his accent kept slipping. Having an interest in the occult I felt that there was a lack of information about the cult, it's beliefs, origins, etc. And the finale was rather sill, but entertaining. However, on the positive side it is visually very good, plenty of colour and great use of Greek locations. The musical score, by Brian Eno, is effectively menacing.

He is the hammiest of the hams with his eyes rolling incessantly, his mischievous leers, his over-pronounced dialogue, and his bombastic gestures.  He makes Vincent Price look like an actor accustomed to giving understated performances. Plainly put - he is fun to watch!  Slaughter was a British actor known primarily for his stage work but he made several pictures.  As with all his films, he is the primary focal-point of attention, and A Face at the Window is no exception.  This is a fun movie to watch and should make you a Tod Slaughter fan.  The story of the movie is complicated and stretches credibility at times, but is to be taken in fun....that is apparent as soon as you see Slaughter say something and gesture about."

In a few cases, however, the quota quickie laws provided opportunity for Britain's seemingly bottomless reserve of superior stage actors to be preserved on film-- that's why we have them to thank for Arthur Wontner's very fine Sherlock Holmes in some (not nearly as fine) Holmes movies, and it's also why we have a healthy collection of films starring the splendid ham Tod Slaughter, who toured for years as a ripsnorting baddie in authentic Victorian melodramas (such as Sweeney Todd) and transferred a number of them with minimal alteration to film. The Face at the Window is reportedly the highest-budgeted of Slaughter's films, and thus probably isn't technically a quota quickie at all, but it's still brought to the screen with the smell of fresh greasepaint straight from the provinces-- specifically the provinces circa 1895.  Slaughter's larger than life performances give us as good a picture of what Victorian audiences ate up as the D'Oyly Carte company did of Gilbert and Sullivan's productions, because like them he was less reviving the old melodramas than carrying on their tradition intact.  You may think you've seen people doing the Snidely Whiplash-style villain, and don't need to see them again, but you haven't lived until you've seen a seemingly sane and proper Slaughter dissolve in maniacal glee-- a-ha, ahahaha, ahahahahahahahahaha!"

Tod is king of horror for one very important reason - he quite evidently enjoys his work. This was the first Tod film I saw and - having heard so much about him prior to this - I feared disappointment. No worries. Despite the cardboard settings and woeful support cast, from the moment he strides masterfully in, we are in the capable hands of a classic film villain. The opening murder with the eerie wolf howl on the soundtracks sets the scene perfectly and then we are treated to an acting masterclass from the great man himself. Whether innocently acting the concerned friend, lecherously trying to sneak a kiss from the heroine, threatening his low-life confederates with a grisly end if they cross him or, worst of all, holding somewhat one-sided conversations with his demented foster brother, Tod holds the film together. The Chevalier is underplayed by Tod compared to Sweeney Todd - but seldom has one man wiggled his eyebrows to more sinister effect. It's a great pity that Universal studios didn't try to to entice him over for their classic horror cycle - Tod would've made a far more spirited Dracula than John Carradine in the later sequels and can't you just see him going toe to toe with Basil Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes. Shame nobody thought of putting him up against Arthur Wontner's in the UK. The double-exposure effects for the appearance of the ""face"" are well done for their time and the whole film compares favourably with the Universal classics of the period."

Donald Hotton, is okay as the priest, was unconvincing at times, but he was okay, and got the job done. Christopher McDonald, is okay in his short role. Perry Lang, is good as Paul i liked him. Overall highly recommended! ***1/2 out of 5"
3870,tt0080853,/review/rw1319271/?ref_=tt_urv,"This very standard early 80's haunted house/possessed souls chiller does feature one ingenious and genuinely creepy gimmick, namely the titular vehicle that mysteriously drives around at night. Barely recovered from personal problems in the big city, Jane Hardy moves to an inherited mansion in a small and very superstitious village. The locals treat her like dirt, especially when they learn Jane is the niece of the previous resident, who worshiped the devil and whose dead body mysteriously vanished when the hearse ran into a bridge and caught fire. It doesn't take long before Jane herself begins to suffer from nightmares and the antique hearse even begins to stalk her! ""The Hearse"" is very slow but occasionally atmospheric and well-acted. Unfortunately however, the script is full of holes, too predictable and the total lack of spectacle is pretty hard to forgive. I respect the fact there were obviously financial limitations to this production, but to deliver an entirely bloodless film is a tad bit exaggerated. Class actor and horror veteran Joseph Cotton (""Baron Blood"", ""The Abominable Dr. Phibes"", ""Island of the Fishmen"") is totally wasted in the role of obnoxious attorney. Crap ending, too."
3871,tt0083976,/review/rw1394120/?ref_=tt_urv,"""Funeral Home"" is very entertaining and traditionally morbid early 80's horror movie directed by the underrated William Fruet, who also made the top-notch revenge flick ""House by the Lake"" and the goofy slasher ""Killer Party"". Fruet obviously hadn't much of a budget available here, so he splendidly emphasizes the horrific atmosphere and makes full use of the eerie settings. A lot of great movies use a bed & a breakfast motel as horror location and the residence in this movie is actually a former mortuary turned into bed & breakfast, so creepiness is definitely guaranteed! Heather, a young girl with an unexplained phobia for black cats, travels to a remote little town to help her grandmother run the newly opened vacation resort. Her grandfather, the local undertaker for decades, mysteriously vanished a couple of years ago and the villagers still spread nasty rumors about him. During the night, Heather hears strange voices coming from the basement and, shortly after, the first guests begin to disappear. The plot offers almost no surprise elements or twists; also since it's clearly a tribute to Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", and the amount of bloody make-up effects is kept to a minimum. Still the tone of the movie is constantly ominous and several sequences are downright creepy, notably the handful of flashbacks referring to the times Mr. Chalmers still ran the funeral home. The acting and music are also very good and the predictably grotesque climax is a lot of fun to watch. Creepy stuff, vintage 80's horror!"
3872,tt0083976,/review/rw1782919/?ref_=tt_urv,"I'm sure I'm in a distinct minority, but I actually like '80's slasher movies more for their atmosphere than for their special effects (which seem to look more cheesy and primitive with each passing year). Unfortunately, the eerie atmosphere of the early slasher movies eventually got overwhelmed, first by out-of-control special effects, then by talentless ""scream queens"" and softcore sex, and finally by cornball comedy and self-conscious parody. That's why I kind of like this film, even if it's nobody's idea of a great slasher flick or a good horror film. It has no gore and no nudity, but it has a good early 80's slasher movie atmosphere."

Don't get me wrong, ""Psycho Cop"" has its moments, but obviously it sinks like a brick after the caretaker meets his demise. He was the glue that held everything together, without him the movie's plot almost seemed incoherent and moronic. And talk about screen presence, no definition is high enough to do the character justice. Oh caretaker, you were truly a God amongst men, nobody could hold an axe for vague reasons like you could. Sadly when you take this ingenious character out of the equation, you're stuck with the kind of average slasher movie people were already sick of back in 1989. Cars never start, phones never work, people keep wandering of into the woods for stupid reasons, dead killers are never as dead as they look, every teen is 35 years old, it's that kind of movie and very little more. Officer Joe Vickers is a pretty amusing psychopath, but I think he's much better in ""Psycho Cop Returns"". He just doesn't have material in this movie. ""Psycho Cop"" is not quite funny and not quite scary either, sort of a failed slasher pastiche."

Apparently The Matrix is a classic, and that movie sucks), I haven't had this much fun watching a B-horror flick in a long long time. The joy of this movie is that instead of being a laughably bad horror that's hysterical because it's so cheesy, it's a laughably bad horror poking fun at itself for being laughably bad and having a damn good time being laughably bad. As will you, watching Psycho Cop Joe Vickers chuckle his way through a veritable army of victims with axe, billy club and even in one instance, a car."

This is probably the most cheesy, ridiculous movie ever, but it cracks me up.  If you thought the teens in those Friday the 13th flicks were stupid, you've not seen anything until you see Psycho Cop.  I must admit they do think of the well being of others though, primarily the caretaker.  They spend most of the movie asking about him and who stole their beer.  Lets not forget the Psycho Cop himself, well he's a satanist and a bit of a comic.  He always has a funny zinger to say after he kills someone.  The dialogue is awesome, for instance: ""I felt someone was watching me, but it turned out to be a deer."" I love this movie!  Ridiculously awesome."

3889,tt8656686,/review/rw8650604/?ref_=tt_urv,"I read the negative reviews and should have listened- they're true. I'm a woman who is tired of watching these overexaggerated depictions of female victimhood. Why can't I just get an entertaining movie that isn't shoving a message down my throat while beating me over the head with it? I was the only female child in a large family of males, I've traveled the world alone, and I pretty much can do anything and everything I want, without being harassed 24/7 by a man. So I guess this message doesn't work on me. I've been sexuality harassed at work and now I don't work there. I've been groped in public and smacked a few for it. I'm not denying it exists, but I think we've mostly acknowledged it as a society. Okay, so where's the solution? I don't need to keep pulling off scabs to prove a point. This movie is one big bloody scab and serves no real purpose. Besides ridiculous plot holes (who the hell puts used bloody tissue back in their purse?! Blech- flush the damn thing) and a long drawn out cat and mouse game that doesn't make much sense, the style and direction were a mish-mash. The oldies music, roller rink scene, breaking the 4th wall, etc. Ended up competing with each other, resulting in no winners. The lead actress was pretty solid, but I grew tired of the ""I need a tampon"" speech real quick when she had a huge gaping wound on her head with no bandage 95% of the time. The ghoul flees when a dog is around, so why not spend the night in a kennel? Done. But wait! We first have to find the underground lady boot camp where spas and karate collide, so we can dress up like Ralph Macchio to destroy an all powerful entity that has survived longer than humans. Ok. I guess sunlight and fire is all they needed, though. Too bad the First Lady never thought to just burn the guy's house down during the daytime these last millenia. So the takeaway is that men are pigs and women will always be victims, until we put on our kimono to kick ass? Pfffft."

Luckily (for him) he inherited a medallion carrying a supernatural force and this allows Arnold's spirit to step out of the body and to commit the murders without leaving a trace. The premise of ""Psychic Killer"" is giant nonsense but it does guarantee a lot of fun and thrills. Besides, there are more than enough elements that indicate that this movie shouldn't be taken too seriously, like the over-the-top acting and the exaggeratedly ludicrous killings. This movie looks suspiciously much like a standard Roger Corman production: the budget is extremely low, but the ingeniousness of the script and the enthusiasm of the B-cast widely make up for it (Neville Brand and Julie Adams are particularly splendid). In case you like older horror and you have a morbid sense of humor, you're destined to like this cute piece of 70's schlock.

In the film, we meet a 33-year-old mental patient named Arnold Masters (Jim Hutton, father of Timothy, 42 here in his final film), who repeatedly declares his innocence of the charge of murdering his dying mother's doctor (his mother had had no health insurance, and so that doctor had refused to perform a lifesaving operation on her; a situation that resonates even more strongly today, 36 years later!). Masters' luck soon takes a decided turn for the better, however, when his innocence is established, a fellow inmate gifts him with a voodoolike amulet, and he is released from confinement. Too bad, though, for all the folks who crossed Masters in the past, as the amulet soon confers on him the ability to slay from afar.

Remember the horror movie you wanted to make when you were a kid? Well, Girdler made it for you. The plot is thin: a beautiful concert pianist (Carla Borelli of ""Days of Our Lives"" and ""Another World"") suffers a minor breakdown and ends up at an old, scary-looking asylum in the country, where she hears sinister chanting and has a number of extremely vivid nightmares. What's going on at Dr. Jason Specter's Pleasant Hill Sanitarium? You'll have to find out for yourself! While most of the cast fails to impress, Charles Kissinger (as Dr. Specter) makes a good bargain-basement Vincent Price. Nick Jolley must have known even at the time that he was delivering a stupendously awful performance as the heroine's hot-tempered, houndstooth-clad boyfriend, and a couple of the bit players--Mimi Honce as another patient at the asylum and Jack Peterkin as the physician who reluctantly transfers Borelli to Kissinger's house of horrors for ""special treatment""--recite their lines in the corny, mock-dignified cadences of daytime TV, suggesting that Girdler plucked them from the same talent pool as his female lead. (Honce sounds like she's doing a Correctol commercial, and Peterkin reveals, in unintentionally hilarious fashion, a gaping continuity error in the script: he says he warned Borelli a year earlier that she was overworked and, literally in the next breath, splutters that ""she's only been under my care a short while!"")

But then again, it qualifies as Mexican exploitation and you never know what to expect from these guys I would love to summarize the plot a little but that's nearly impossible considering this is an incoherent series of absurdity, sleaze and semi-psychedelic stuff. The closest I can get is describing how the story takes place in a French asylum hidden in the woods, where doctor Tarr and professor Feather feast their most perverted barbarities on the poor and helpless patientsand yet they like it! My personal favorite is a guy  referred to as Mr. Chicken  who lives in a pen, alongside the other poultry. You should see how happy he is!! The screenplay is supposed to be adapted from an Edgar Allen Poe story but, even though I haven't read it, I suspect that the premise is replenished with many elements from the makers' own wicked imagination. As often the case with this type of cheap exploitation films, it features a surprisingly stylish cinematography and many addictive elements. Especially the mesmerizing opening sequence, with its wonderful blaze of colors, immediately draws your attention. The use of silly music is hilarious and you can only feel sympathy for the actor while they're attempting to rattle their exaggeratedly complex dialogues. This is the kind of cinema that normal human beings refer to as crap and complete rubbish. Only the people with a macabre sense of humor love it and regret that there aren't more films like this to find. I, for one, am proud to have it in my cult-collection."

3925,tt0068504,/review/rw1133960/?ref_=tt_urv,"""The Mansion of Madness"" is a long forgotten surreal horror comedy from directer Juan Lopez Moctezuma. Most notorious for ""Alucarda"". ""Mansion of Madness"" contains a couple cast members from ""El Topo"" including cinematographer Rafiel Corkidi. The movie is loosely based on a short story from Edgar Allan Poe. The plot concerns a weird and deranged insane asylum where the patients take over and make up their own rules. Doctors out of the way! There's rooms full of crazy lunatics including people who act like chickens. Actor Claudio Brook is in charge of the madness. Fans of Jodorosky, Arrabal, Fellini and Ken Russel will definitely find this film enjoyable. It's also known as ""Dr. Tarr's Torture Dungeon"". Not to worry, there's more surreal art than torture in this flick. So why not check in, to the mansion of madness?"

The film nicely captures and expands Edgar Allan Poe's 1845 short story ""The System of Dr. Tarr and Prof. Fether"" (one of many that Roger Corman never got around to adapting!), and shows what can happen when the inmates of a madhouse literally take over the asylum. In the film, we make the acquaintance of a young man named Gaston Leblanc who has recently graduated from journalism school in 19th century America, and played by hunky dude Arthur Hansel (who looks a good 20 years too old for the part). Leblanc returns to his French homeland to do a story on a mental institution run by one Dr. Maillard (Claudio Brook, the doctor turned demon slayer in ""Alucarda""), whose innovative ""soothing system"" of letting his inmates run free has been causing quite a stir in medical circles.

It's cheesy and low-budget, unfolding like a stage-play ineptly filmed, with a script dulled by timid ideas and old-school misogyny. Yet in Patricia Laffan, the British actress who plays Nyah the Devil Girl, this picture presents a space-queen unrivaled in the annals of B-movie campiness. Her dominatrix boots and patent-leather cape, not to mention her highbrow imperious accent, easily outclass the features on display from those Venusian babes in Queen of Outer Space (1958) or the Martianettes in Flight to Mars (1951). And check out that Devil Girl headgear, a cross between medieval helmet and Egyptian sphinx! In silhouette, Nyah is the image of Darth Vader, striding about with cape swirling to do something unspeakably naughty. But before you conclude that Ms. Laffan's over-the-top performance is an instance of bad acting, consider this: there's no way to play a character like Nyah with psychological depth. The Devil Girl is a comic-book villainess, an icon, somebody who has to be bigger than big. Patricia Laffan is the perfect drama queen to meet the challenge. If you like her in this movie, be sure to see her in Quo Vadis? (1951), a glorious sword and sandal epic that also features the burning of Rome and the martyrdom of the Christians. In that film Laffan plays Poppaea, wicked Empress of Rome, opposite Peter Ustinov's even more formidable Emperor Nero. From bride of the Roman Antichrist to warrior-woman of Mars is just a small step -- or should I say, it's a small step for Patricia Laffan, but a giant leap for anyone else."

It's ninety minutes of sheer torture, starring a hideous cast of makeup nightmares; indisputable evidence of the lengths a commercial property can stretch for the almighty dollar. Like most children of the eighties, I had a healthy collection of GPK stickers in my closet growing up. The gross-out humor and macabre illustrations were a big selling point, but beneath all that was a creative core and a wild amount of versatility. Every card was completely different. The one-note comedy of their film translation, though, is like opening a pack filled with duplicates. I counted six jokes with a visual punchline of ""and then he peed his pants."" That's not an exaggeration, and it's not the only example of the flick's careless comedic redundancy. Combine that with an appalling song and dance number (seriously), a horribly out-of-place romantic subplot (starring a pre-pubescent boy and a girl well into her twenties, no less) and a gang of foils cut clumsily from recycled cardboard.

If, for example, there existed an Oscar for the coolest movie title, it would guaranteed be won by a horror or Sci-Fi flick almost every year! ""The Terrornauts"" definitely would have deserved the Oscar for coolest title back in 1967, that's for certain, even though it's a completely irrelevant title. There isn't much ""terror"" here and the main characters arguably don't even qualify as ""astronauts"" either. Then again who needs the Academy Awards; because I've never seen an Oscar winning film that provided me with so much entertainment and chuckles than ""The Terrornauts"". Thus far I always assumed that ""First Men in the Moon"" (Nathan Juran – 1964) was the cheesiest and most pleasantly deranged Sci-Fi movie to hail from England, but that was before I discovered this even crazier and more imaginative little accomplishment from the Amicus Studios. It's practically impossible to describe the plot of ""The Terrornauts"", but I'll give it a try anyways. Dr. Joe Burke, along with his girlfriend Sandy and co- worker Ben, is running operation Star Talk. His mission is to intercept radio signals from outer space in order to prove the existence of other intelligent life forms. He's devoted to his job because, as a child, he once had a vivid dream about being on a planet where he could breathe normally. But since his project is unsuccessful for the past four years and quite expensive at the same time, a grumpy government official now informs Dr. Burke that the project will be terminated in three months. But then suddenly Dr. Burke receives signals, hallelujah! He responds to them and, before they properly understand what is going on, their entire laboratory is sucked out of its fundaments and into a massive space ship! The crew, including the talkative coffee lady and a nerdy financial auditor sent by the government, is hosted by a tacky robot and forced to participate in hallucinating experiments. They also stumble upon a portal that leads them directly to – oh yes – the planet that Dr. Burke dreamed about as a child! Do I really need to re-emphasize that ""The Terrornauts"" is downright awesome?!? Whoever wrote the script of this movie was permanently high on excellent drugs and the team in charge of the special effects and costume designs must have been even crazier! At a certain point in the film the group runs into a flamboyant monster with tentacles on its head and one giant eye on the lower left side, whilst on the planet our heroine is chased by green-faced aliens that want to ritually sacrifice her.

Add to the mix Ozzie Davis as a man convinced he is John F. Kennedy and a mummy that sucks the souls of geriatric residents and you have the basic premise behind Bubba Ho-tep. But beyond all that and the jokes about Elvis's genitalia and other low brow references is a film with a tremendous amount of heart and a message about the elderly in our society and how we have, as a society, betrayed them and cast them aside. The script and effective direction of Phantasm's Don Coscarelli make this film work on several levels. It is a comedy. It is a drama. It is a horror film. It has all those elements. You care about the characters and are drawn into this seedy little world. The biggest asset the film has is its performances. Davis gives a fine turn and adds credibility to the film, but Bruce Campbell as the king just bowled me over. I had seen him before, but I had never seen him act like this before.

The ape-man has a penchant for chasing voluptuous Mexican ladies and tearing their blouse and bra off. For some reason he also likes to rip the heads off of human males. Surely this is the consequence of his animal heart! The movie also features the obligatory masked wrestling women, the heroine in this instance having almost no connection with the ape-man or his evil scientist creator, but the dialogue makes for extremely bad/funny sequences. There is much red paint splattered about and some obviously phony gore scenes. A great and good laugh for the twisted soul such as myself."

I'd just finished a pirate movie with Tommy Lee Jones, Michael O'Keefe and Jenny Seagrove and a lot of theatre. Michael (Hurst) was also a fellow theatre actor and we went on after this to do a couple of stage plays together. As was also noted, Michael went on to do 'Hercules'. At the time, Fangoria was the genre magazine of choice, and, with David (Blyth) and Murray (Newey - RIP) and the script by Michael Heath, with the 80's sex chic of the nurses, designed by Micahel Glock, we hit Auckland with all the energy that a 4 week shoot can muster.

3977,tt0089002,/review/rw1840229/?ref_=tt_urv,"Personally I'm convinced ""Death Warmed Up"" was completed by a clique of people suffering from Attention Deficit Disorder (the infamous A.D.D. syndrome) Either that or a bunch of mushroom-addicted guys with a permanent overdose of acid in their blood. How else would you clarify the film's total lack of narrative structure, the exaggeratedly high amount of nonsensical plot-twists, the overzealous editing, the demented characters and the copious number of grotesquely over-the-top grossness? ""Death Warmed Up"" is a wildly incoherent and thoroughly bizarre horror effort from New Zealand  reputedly the country's first full-blooded genre outing  that more or less describes itself as a demented and very loose interpretation of the legendary ""Island of Dr. Moreau"" tale. But then again, Dr. Moreau at least had a clear mission he wanted to achieve whereas Dr. Archer Howell, the lunatic scientist in this film, seemingly just surrounds himself with a large collection of genetically altered freaks for his own personal amusement. Throughout the entire film, his motivations for performing medical experiments on random island people remain unexplained. He has freaky half-man and half-monster guinea pigs working for him, creepy guys without eyebrows running loose and an entire army of deformed abnormalities locked away in a basement. The predominant storyline, however, revolves on one of Dr. Howell's very first victims seeking vengeance for the agony he cost. As a teenager, Michael got brainwashed and shotgun-massacred his own parents under the malignant influence of Dr. Howell. He spent the following seven years in a mental institution, but now Michael's back (with a new and Blade Runner type of hairdo) and unstoppably furious. Along with his girl and a befriended couple, Michael ferries to Dr. Howell's island resort, but they'll have to face his creations first before they can get to him. ""Death Warmed Up"" is, well, shall I say  completely bonkers! The script makes very little sense (or even no sense at all) and leaps from one subject to another all the time. Michael & C° supposedly come for revenge, yet they start their trip by going to the beach and during several situations it's actually Michael's friend Lucas who proves to be the most courageous one of the bunch. There are plenty of odd homosexual undertones in the film, as well as some misplaced attempts at humor (the Indian store clerk) and a bizarre type of ambiance I can't possibly categorize. One thing ""Death Warmed Up"" does deliver plenty of, however, is gore and bloodshed! The aforementioned shotgun killings are supremely nasty, and they're just at the beginning of the film. Furthermore, there are repugnant brain surgeries, impalements and gooey zombie make-up effects aplenty. The zombie creatures are quite menacing, particularly the bloke without eyebrows (displayed on the cover-image) and the typical New Zealand accents and slang are a joy to listen to. The acting performances are below average and insignificant, still devoted horror fans should keep an eye open for a brief appearance by Ian Watkin (awesome, arse-kicking uncle Les from ""Braindead"") as Bill the ferryman. ""Death Warmed Up"" is far too unbalanced to be considered as a worthwhile horror outing, but it's still a fun and gore-soaked excuse to spend 85 minutes of your time."

3984,tt0090186,/review/rw4022483/?ref_=tt_urv,"There's something curiously fascinating about the obscure and almost entirely forgotten mid-80s slasher entitled ""Too Scared to Scream"". In the blessed year 1985, director Tony Lo Bianco (primarily an actor and probably best known for his role as Lonely Hearts Murderer Ray Fernandez in ""The Honeymoon Killers"") seemingly attempted to make a mix of two specific exploitation sub-genres that were at the end of their glory days. I may just be imagining things, of course, but yours truly spotted in ""Too Scared to Scream"" a tribute to both the Italian Giallo and those typical New York 42nd Street Grindhouse trash flicks. The similarities with the Giallo are mainly to be found in the plotting department, as the film deals with a sadist killer who preferably slaughters lewd women when they are completely undressed and his/her favorite weapon is a giant butcher knife! There also are several (poor) attempts at plot twists, red herrings and even a surprise ending that is far-fetched and downright hilarious. As the icing on the cake, the investigation is led by a grumpy detective almost as misogynist as the culprit self. The link with the 42nd Street Grindhouse cinema obviously lies within the New York filming locations and its portrayal of the city. Very much like in modest classics such as ""Maniac"", ""Ms. 45"", ""Night of the Juggler"" and ""The Exterminator"", this film is like an anti-tourist campaign for the city of New York! Nothing you see here will ever make you want to go city-tripping in the Big Apple! The cast is full of unlikable people and many scenes play at raunchy, neon-lit districts. The horror action mostly takes place at a wannabe fancy hotel, the Royal Arms, where apparently unrelated residents turn up savagely murdered. The script desperately wants us to believe that the killer is the eccentric night porter / aspiring Broadway actor Vincent Hardwick, but I don't think anyone is gullible enough to believe he's the one. In spite of many flaws and too many boring parts, ""Too Scared to Scream"" is nonetheless enjoyable if you're a fan of eighties slashers and/or the above-mentioned exploitation sub-genres."
3985,tt0090186,/review/rw0227651/?ref_=tt_urv,"Purists or experts might disagree, but I believe ""Too Scared To Scream"" is an earnest attempt by the filmmakers to create an American version of the Italian ""giallo"" thrillers. Although the violence isn't particularly graphic, the film plays like a murder mystery in which you think you know who the murderer is, but you can't be sure until the last frame. It does have its flaws (some obvious red herrings, some ridiculous ""fake scares""), but it offers a few tense moments, an unexpected (if far-fetched) conclusion, and good performances by most of the cast (especially by the man who plays the chief suspect). A good choice for mystery fans. (**)"

It's up to no-nonsense Dr. Cardan (Mexican horror icon Hugo Stiglitz in properly stalwart form) to stop Devlon before it's too late. Writer/director Ruben Galindo, Jr. does an adept job of creating and sustaining a supremely creeped-out skin-crawling midnight-in-the-graveyard brooding gloom-doom atmosphere and keeps the pace bumping along at a steady clip before pulling out all the stops with a gloriously wild and exciting all hell's breaking loose climax depicting a hostile bunch of shambling zombies bursting forth from their graves with malign intent. Moreover, Rosalio Solano's rough, but agile cinematography, the grimly serious tone, enthusiastic acting from an attractive and engaging cast (gorgeous brunette Edna Bolkan in particular makes for a really fetching and appealing damsel in distress), the ever-popular have sex and die cliché, Carlos Savage's spirited shivery'n'shuddery synthesizer score, a handy helping of graphic gore, and a fiercely no-fooling open season on everyone take-no-prisoners harsh attitude all give this film a certain deliciously macabre charm.

Set in the year 1998, it looks too frightening enough to make us wonder how hard we're surviving a lot of society's problems. Imagine what mankind's future would be like someday! The film has an inventive twist to the usual gun-toting theme. In it, a crippled teenager uses a radio controlled device via his computer to hunt down and blast his enemies to kingdom come! That effect makes for some slow pacing, and the film itself goes downhill a bit, but it's almost predictable for the viewer to find out what happens next. Those hospital announcements and voice-overs heard several times are silly and annoying, but they often stage its dark, frightful, maybe controversial setting.

The film is by no means great or even good, yet something in it makes it so memorable to those of us writing here.  I am not sure what that quality is - maybe we see ourselves in this protagonist in small pieces.  I don't want to get too psychological here, but it must be something about the film.  The film is about a young man picked on by all who loves biology and the experiments he has been working on all summer.  Everyone at this school..and I mean everyone except a young girl that admires the young man for his intellect...is cruel, sadistic, and totally uncharacteristic of what you would find in teachers and the like.  He experiences one shocking mistreatment after another, until forced to drink a serum he has been working on, becomes a Hyde-like character that avenges himself for all the wrongs redressed towards him by all his enemies.

Having seen the director's cut at a screening in San Francisco, I can attest to the superiority of the original, rarely seen version.  The audience's sympathy for the beleaguered hero remains intact despite the even more vivid violence he perpetrates in the murder scenes."
4005,tt0072331,/review/rw1196572/?ref_=tt_urv,"Really really bad movie. Fun to watch. Young bullied chemistry nerd accidentally becomes his own guinea pig. Movie is crazily stitched together. There is a large sequence that documents the personal life of his absent father and his rocky relationship with his girlfriend, just enough to make them seem like important characters, then the sequence arbitrarily ends and we never see them again. There is a janitor that apparently lives at the school and dresses like a homeless man. There is also another sequence that borders homo-eroticism that involves half naked football players in a circle playing 'keep away' against the nerd, who fruitlessly and limply throws his body mass at them in a halfhearted effort to get back his belongings. The English teacher is a sadist, and the police force is incredibly inept. Very strange movie, but a gem for people that love movies so bad they are fun to watch. This one is one for your collection.

It involves a yuppie and his wife visiting some big American city (not sure they even named which one, but it mostly seemed to be Chicago) for a job interview and maybe a nice dinner before heading home to some unknown suburb to get back to reality. Maybe it wasn't an interview. On second thought, the guy may have been just looking for an investor for a business venture. Anyway, it hardly matters by about 10 minutes in. The first guy he meets isn't interested, and the next guy he is supposed to meet never shows up at the bar he expected him to be.

He's got the perfect wife, lovely children and a beautiful home, just on the outskirts of San Francisco, in the (seemingly) peaceful middle of nowhere, to be exact.  While his wife and kids have left town for the weekend, he is left all alone on his 40th birthday.  This is where it all begins."

You kick them right back out on the street, of course! That'll teach them to interfere with a perfectly happy family! Well, that is what you should do in order to prevent guaranteed catastrophes to happen the next morning, but admittedly very few male individuals are likely to respond like this. Neither does the handsome George Manning in ""Death Game"", so he's stuck up with two obtrusive chicks in his house. Their behavior gets more psychotic with each hour that passes, until they even set up a fake trial against poor tied up George. ""Death Game"" is not a very good movie, but that's merely because there was too little money available for the execution and because Peter S. Traynor has no clue how to direct a suspense movie. The basic premise is quite unusual for a 70's exploitation movie (usually slavering hillbillies terrorize poor young girls instead of vice versa) and the whole concept is actually very much ahead of its time! Especially nowadays, the horror genre brings forward a lot of movies revolving on brutal home-invasions. People are subjected to fear and torture in their own houses and it's a very popular and money-making concept at the moment, like for example in ""Funny Games"" and ""The Strangers"", but this crazed little movie already did something similar in the 70's! The 40 first minutes of ""Death Game"" provide silly entertainment (Sondra Loncke at the breakfast table) and irresistible trashy goodness (that soundtrack!!), but unfortunately the second half of the film is incomprehensibly boring and unexciting. It shouldn't be, since the girls get more deranged and all, but it suddenly feels as if the writers' inspiration had vanished and only padding remained. There are still two fantastic highlights to experience near the end, though! One involves a pussycat (did you know glass windows aren't cat-proof?) and the other is a stupendously laugh-out-loud hysterical ending. Even a threesome wouldn't have such a fantastic climax!

To hear the upbeat tempo of the William Tell Overture truly does bring shivers to old fans' spines once more. Spilsbury, despite a nationwide search, was not a good choice for the Lone Ranger. He is not especially tall, broad shouldered, or very heroic in his movments. And obviously his voice was not good enough for the role either, as James Keach was brought in to dub over Spilsbury's lines. However, Spilsbury does prove to be physically capable, and his fight scenes and shoot outs are very much like the legendary Clayton Moore's. Michael Horse has departed from Jay Silverheel's monosyllabic and subservant version of Tonto. He is an activistic sidekick, prepared to defend his people to a fault, even if he has to step over his partner, the Ranger. Look for fairly good acting from the various co-stars, including Christopher Lloyd as the fiendish Butch Cavendish, Richard Farnsworth as Buffalo Bill, and especially Jason Robards as a frequently inebriated President U.S. Grant.

This, for the most part, has to do with the supremely talented cast involved. '70's Scream Queen Pamela Franklin, fresh out of Richard Matheson's nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat suspense thriller THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, stars as a young woman who enrolls in a distinguished all-girls' school to probe her sister's mysterious suicide. The plot reminds me of Dario Argento's horror classic SUSPIRIA, but this TV movie was actually made four years before Argento's film, so perhaps Argento pilfered from this little seen gem. Kate Jackson and Cheryl Ladd, before they became 'Charlie's Angels', co-starred as two of Franklin's fellow classmates.

Rather than concentrate on characters or story, the film leans more towards aesthetics; as the tale is portrayed within a very creepy atmosphere, and the central monsters of the title capitalise well on their natural scare factor. Like clowns, scarecrows are eerie creations and it's clear that director William Wesley knows that, as their dark and foreboding image makes up the backbone of this tale of terror. The only real theme that is put on display in this film comes from the idea of greed, as it is that very thing that gets all the central protagonists into life-threatening danger. The film follows a bunch of soldiers that have stolen a lot of money. They take a pilot and his daughter hostage and force the pair to take them to Mexico; but the ride has a hitch when one of the crooks decides that he doesn't want to share the money, and parachutes out of the plane with the loot.

One would think this would be a real turkey only good for a few laughs, but not so, it's a surprisingly effective thriller with atmosphere to spare. One of the reasons I enjoy horror movies is that creative directors are capable of making something special out of virtually nothing. 'Carnival Of Souls' and 'Night Of The Living Dead' are obvious examples. El cheapo budgets, unknown actors, minimal effects, but two of the greatest horror movies ever made. I'm not saying 'Shock Waves' is anywhere near THAT good, but I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected from the cheesy packaging on the video box. The concept of underwater Nazi zombies is an intriguing one, and was subsequently used by Jean Rollin and Jess Franco in 'Zombie Lake' and 'Oasis Of The Zombies'. I always enjoy seeing John Carradine, but his role is, let's be honest, little more than a cameo. I have a major crush on Brooke Adams, she's goofy but beautiful, and admirers won't want to miss this one as she spends most of her time in a bikini. One minor complaint - I wished Peter Cushing had more screen time. He's my favourite horror actor after Vincent Price and I always enjoy his performances. All in all 'Shock Waves' is an underrated and creepy movie that all horror buffs should try and see. It's just one of many overlooked 1970s horror gems that deserve more attention than they get (see also 'Count Yorga, Vampire', 'The Brotherhood Of Satan', 'The Crazies', 'The Legend Of Hell House', 'Deranged', 'Alice, Sweet Alice', 'Thirst',etc.etc.)"

4101,tt0097664,/review/rw3244597/?ref_=tt_urv,"""Kill Slade"" is an obscure late '80s South-African action/trash flick that practically nobody has ever seen, or at least I assume so because mine is the first and only user-comment on IMDb. This either means that it's a worthless piece of rubbish that doesn't deserve to be available on DVD, or that I accidentally stumbled upon a genuine undiscovered gem! During the first 10-15 minutes, and particularly during the opening sequence, I actually started hoping that the latter was really the case! Somewhere in a dark and secret hangar, a photographer is taking shots of a variety of illegal activities when suddenly a criminal sleazebag (Danny Keogh) sneaks up behind him and slits his throat. This scene is quite brutal and shocking, so for a moment there I was wondering why ""Kill Slade"" is so unknown. The film remains fairly intriguing for another ten minutes, as it turns out that the murdered photographer was the partner of the ambitious journalist J.J and she's working on a controversial report about fraudulent business within the United Nations food-aid and charity collecting. The killer – Flannigan – asks his dumb pal Slade to kidnap J.J. and keep her locked up in her tent for a couple of days. As soon as the kidnapping took place, ""Kill Slade"" gradually turns into a dire and dreadful action/comedy, and you'll immediately understand why the film ended up in oblivion. The rest of the script exists of lame bickering between the journalist and her kidnapper, who by the way is the most pathetic action hero of the eighties. Patrick Dollaghan doesn't only look like an idiot; he also talks and behaves like one. During the climax there's another worthwhile sequence, involving a man being eaten by crocodiles, but then even this sequence is ruined when the victims suddenly re- appears again a little bit later. You just don't reappear after a croc- attack!"
4102,tt0097664,/review/rw8990572/?ref_=tt_urv,My review was written in August 1989 after watching the film on Orion/Nelson video cassette.
4103,tt0268711,/review/rw3112000/?ref_=tt_urv,"Entertaining but middling ¨Spanish Slasher¨ in which a series killer executes a crime spree at Salamanca University . Students of the university of Salamanca are brutally murdered by a black masked minstrel nicknamed ¨Tuno Negro¨ . As a psychopathic killer infiltrates in the ""University Tuna"" of Salamanca and chooses his victims via the internet . Alex (Silke) , an architecture student who has recently moved to Salamanca discovers a pattern behind the killings ; it seems as if the murderer strikes regularly after the exams to free the campus from worse students . Relying on the night and the students spree (Jorge Sanz , Patxi Freytez , Sergio Pazos , Javier Veiga) , the ""Tuno Negro"" commits murders with a simple pattern , as he kills the worst students in each class . The lousy student does not end the course , nor will have the option to repeat it . As murderous tells the following : Nescientia Necat (it is Latin and means ""Ignorance kills"") . Meanwhile , two police inspectors (Fele Martínez , Enrique Villen) are investigating the weird killings and a strange professor (Eusebio Poncela) discovers an ancient legend from XVI Century dealing with the ¨Tunos Negros¨ who were executed by burning pole . "
4104,tt0268711,/review/rw1379525/?ref_=tt_urv,"Anyone that has visited Spain, especially in the large cities, and university towns, has had the opportunity to encounter the famous minstrels that go to touristy places to sing and entertain in exchange for a few coins they will probably use for a meal, or a drink. These young men are a lot of fun to watch interpreting those old songs that have been passed from generation to generation."
4105,tt0268711,/review/rw0779664/?ref_=tt_urv,"Like `El arte de Morir', this is a Spanish example of the teen slasher pic, that has some original ideas, but isn't as good as the efforts of other Spanish directors in horror film making, like Amenabar's `Tesis', de la Iglesia's `Dia de la bestia' or del Toro's marvelous `Devil's Backbone'. Still it is a lot better than the boring and predictable `I know what you did last summer', which had nothing, absolutely nothing new or inventive to it. The story tells of a secret society of serenade singers, and, guess what, lots of students are being killed. One of the highlights of `Tuno Negro' is the impressive setting at the university of Salamanca, a location that gives the film a slightly Gothic touch. Then there's the female lead: an interesting divergence from the usually dull well-behaved heroines in Slasher flicks; I liked Silke's acting a lot, although the version I've seen has been dubbed into German; can't say nothing about her original way of speaking that got criticized below. This is certainly not a masterpiece, but it's quite entertaining; I've seen much worse than that."
4106,tt0268711,/review/rw0779667/?ref_=tt_urv,"Very good Spanish slasher movie, with an interesting and darkly humorous idea (a slashing minstrel going from one university to another each year, killing the worst students, cutting the bad seeds of society)."
4107,tt8041270,/review/rw8207383/?ref_=tt_urv,"This movie consists mostly of us watching previously known characters doing whatever theyre doing now, meandering nowhere plot wise, while getting in random tight spots . For some reason they believed fans want to see a repeat of 1st movie and its characters instead of a new quality story and interesting content. Also EVERY SINGLE tight spot they find themselves in with dinosaurs is same formula."
4108,tt8041270,/review/rw8363576/?ref_=tt_urv,"Bad script, bad acting, stupid story, a new dinosaur every 5 minutes, too long, no suspense, Chris Pratt doing the hand thing, $160 million dollar budget for this, so many pointless dinosaur fights AND you took 2 and a half hours to tell me this garbage story."
4109,tt8041270,/review/rw8222042/?ref_=tt_urv,"If I were to list out all the things this movie focuses on, dinosaurs would be fifth or sixth, behind multiple storylines that range from bland to useless. I'm baffled by how little focus is on dinosaurs. And I don't just mean they are barely onscreen. The original Jurassic Park barely had any for the first hour. But everything leading up to that, the story, dialogue and themes, were all focused on dinosaurs."
4110,tt8041270,/review/rw8265997/?ref_=tt_urv,"Before I went to this film (because my Grandson is nuts about this series of films) I read one newspaper review. It wasn't glowing, but it was positive. Unfortunately, this is a mess. Others have already talked about the issues I have. Granted, this is an empty headed summer movie, it could still have been done with some serious thought. I was hanging in there throughout with a new dinosaur attack every three minutes, and velociraptors going at fifty miles per hour and not getting tired. Humans being assaulted time after time and yet showing no fatigue. I also didn't see a scratch on any of them. But the best of all was the promise made to a baby dinosaur and his mother that precluded saving the world from famine. Not to mentioned the coincidences of everyone showing up in just the right places. I still don't understand how they got into that facility so easily. The return of the original cast was not helpful other than Jeff Goldblum's sarcasm. Anyway, it's all been said. This is a poor movie."
4111,tt14465706,/review/rw8675954/?ref_=tt_urv,I will assume that anybody intending to watch this film will have seen the original; if not it won't make too much sense as no time is wasted introducing characters or their situation. Protagonist Lino is still determined to capture the corrupt former policeman responsible for the death of his mentor. Unfortunately for him others are less keen. Senior officers want to offer him a deal to bring down corrupt senior officers still in the force and those corrupt officers want to kill him. If Lino is to get justice he will have to face more danger; mostly behind the wheel of his mentor's heavily modified Renault 21.
4112,tt14465706,/review/rw8666841/?ref_=tt_urv,Lost Bullet 2 is a spectacular gritty action movie. The primary plot of the movie is a direct follow up to the first movie the main character seeking vengeance in a fun way for the audience. The main character has to get to it and then get it to the right people plenty of amazing fight scenes and cool car chases all the way. Let the fun begin for the audience.
4113,tt14465706,/review/rw8753554/?ref_=tt_urv,"There was certainly a lot more happening with the action and suspense, but I found the story had too many inconsistencies and kept bouncing between pot holes and ridiculousness in the narrative. It's like the writers couldn't decide if Lino should be the antagonist or protagonist. Plus the entire narrative was really unfocused and didn't build much from the first film, and it seemed they were aiming for a more Fast and Furious ridiculousness feel; the action was a little too phony and overboard. Nevertheless, the action was choreographed well, all casting and performances spot-on, and the great pacing made the 98 min runtime fly by. Hopefully if there's a third installment, we'll get the continuation that will actually include Areski for than a few minutes."

4115,tt1745960,/review/rw8168012/?ref_=tt_urv,"Wow. The first Top Gun is a classic, and as we all know, sequels/remakes rarely beat the original, especially 36 years later e.g. The Matrix Resurrections. Well, this film just broke that theory."
4116,tt1745960,/review/rw8177338/?ref_=tt_urv,"If you were a late teen or in your early twenties in the mid 1980's the world was very different. No computers, no mobile phones, no internet, no DVD's. We had cars though, and bikes, and we loved them, and we loved films too. The original Top Gun captured this moment in time perfectly, and gave us a thrilling ride like we had never seen before. The humour, the games, the bikes, the aircraft and my word, those flying scenes. We went back to the cinema to see it again and again, and spent the following decades quoting the movie. As time went on, it remained like a static snapshot in time to perfectly represent that magical point in our lives for so many of us."
4117,tt1745960,/review/rw8173679/?ref_=tt_urv,"In one of the more memorable lines in the original Top Gun, Maverick gets chewed out by a superior who tells him, ""Son, your ego's writing checks your body can't cash."" Sometimes I wonder if Tom Cruise took that putdown as a personal challenge. No movie star seems to work harder or push himself further than Cruise these days. Ridiculously entertaining Top Gun: Maverick. Cruise was in his early 20s when he first played Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, the cocky young Navy pilot with the aviator sunglasses, the Kawasaki motorcycle and the need for speed. In the sequel, he's as arrogant and insubordinate as ever: Now a Navy test pilot in his late 50s, Maverick still knows how to tick off his superiors, as we see in an exciting opening sequence where he pushes a new plane beyond its limits. Partly as punishment, he's ordered to return to TOPGUN, the elite pilot-training school, and train its best and brightest for an impossibly dangerous new mission. And so the three screenwriters of Top Gun: Maverick - including Cruise's regular Mission: Impossible writer-director, Christopher McQuarrie - have taken the threads of the original and spun them into an intergenerational male weepie, a dad movie of truly epic proportions. They're tapping into nostalgia for the original, while aiming for new levels of emotional grandeur. To that end, the soundtrack features a Lady Gaga song, ""Hold My Hand."" It's nowhere near as iconic a chart topper as the original movie's ""Take My Breath Away,"" but tugs at your heartstrings nonetheless. The action sequences are much more thrilling and immersive than in the original. You feel like you're really in the cockpit with these pilots, and that's because you are: The actors underwent intense flight training and flew actual planes during shooting. In that respect, Top Gun: Maverick feels like a throwback to a lost era of practical moviemaking, before computer-generated visual effects took over Hollywood. You start to understand why Cruise, the creative force behind the movie, was so driven to make it: In telling a story where older and younger pilots butt heads, and state-of-the-art F-18s duke it out with rusty old F-14s, he's trying to show us that there's room for the old and the new to coexist. He's also advancing a case for the enduring appeal of the movies and their power to transport us with viscerally gripping action and big, sweeping emotions."
4118,tt1745960,/review/rw8178255/?ref_=tt_urv,"This is one sequel that looked like it would never get made. It was stuck in development ""hell"" for years and years. Then it was delayed by COVID and other issues. Its almost as if we were not meant to see a sequel to Top Gun. But now it is here and the question is, was it worth the wait? The answer is a resounding yes. This is the only sequel I have ever seen that i liked BETTER then the original. EVERYTHING about this film rocks! Tom Cruise is sixty this year but he can still do the job! He is awesome as Maverick capturing emotions and giving a performance that he hasn't given since A Few Good Men. You see Maverick's innate cockiness (something all fighter pilots have I'm sure) but you also see his vulnerability and his pain especially the scenes where he talks about his dead wingman's son and how he can't bear the thought of him dying as well. Jennifer Connally and Miles Teller give great performances as well playing Maverick's love interest and Goose's son. Yes you 1980's music lovers we get to hear Kenny Loggin's Danger Zone at the beginning it is wonderful nostalgia. Oh and I should also mention the aieral sequences are the best and most intense in movie history you are on the edge of your seat the whole time. To wrap it all up I wanted to mention the touching scene where Maverick goes to see his old Top Gun classmate ""Iceman"" who is now an Admiral and dying of throat cancer. Val Kilmer looks so bad because he has had throat cancer and can no longer speak well. The scene is so sad but they have a joke at the end where he asks Maverick who the best pilot is? Go see this movie by all means!"

That isn't always a bad thing it's just this film annoyed because of it as felt for a first time directing that Carlson has some real directing talent. I'm sure some sort of message was meant to be portrayed, I just found the end feeling I was left with was frustrating.

Soon people start dieing and all fingers are pointing in Krakowski direction. The movie surfs the fine line between comedy and horror very well.

From the onset, the film makes no qualms about what it is trying to achieve. A group of people set out to prove that monsters are real by interviewing 3 people who claim to be real life monsters. It is a premise that writes itself. The acting is competent, and most of the actors are quite talented. The standout of this film, by far, are the special effects. The Skinwalker and the vampire were really well done, and the action scenes were filmed with a competence usually exerted by bigger budget films. It seems like whoever budgeted this movie made it a point to not skimp out on the SFX, and this elevated the film to a much higher standard. I was constantly impressed by some of the make-up and transformations. If more independent movies allocated their funds to SFX, they would produce much more entertaining films. Overall, it is a decent film that does some incredibly clever things that have not been attempted before. If nothing else, people should watch this film just to see an original and unique production. It is a rarity in this age of sequels."
